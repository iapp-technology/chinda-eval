The user wrote in Thai. They want a summary of more than 300 words. They also want no commas? They say \"อย่าใช้เครื่องหมายจุลภาค\" which means \"do not use commas\". So we must avoid commas. Also they want at least 3 highlighted parts in markdown with asterisks: \"*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 1*\", \"*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 2*\", \"*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 3*\". They want at least 3 parts highlighted in markdown. They want a summary of more than 300 words. They want no commas. That is a challenge: we need to write a long paragraph with no commas. We must avoid commas entirely. That means we cannot use commas in the text. We must be careful. Also we need to include at least 3 highlighted parts. The highlighted parts are \"*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 1*\", \"*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 2*\", \"*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 3*\". They want them in markdown format. So we can include them as bullet points or separate lines. They want at least 3 parts highlighted. We can include them as separate lines. We must not use commas anywhere. That includes the highlighted parts? The highlighted parts themselves contain commas? They don't. They are \"*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 1*\" etc. They don't contain commas. So we can include them. We must ensure no commas in the rest of the text. We must also ensure the summary is more than 300 words. We need to count words. Let's aim for about 350-400 words. We must avoid commas. That means we cannot use \"Raymond III, Count of Tripoli\" with a comma. We can say \"Raymond III Count of Tripoli\" or \"Raymond III the Count of Tripoli\". We must avoid commas. Also we cannot use \"Tripoli, Lebanon\" etc. We must avoid commas. We can use \"Tripoli Lebanon\" or \"Tripoli in Lebanon\". We must be careful.

So we need to rewrite sentences without commas. We can use semicolons? But semicolons are punctuation. The instruction says \"อย่าใช้เครื่องหมายจุลภาค\" which means \"do not use commas\". It doesn't forbid semicolons. But we can avoid them too. We can use periods. We can use conjunctions. We can use \"and\" but we must avoid \"and\" with a comma. We can use \"and\" but no comma. So we can write sentences like \"Raymond III Count of Tripoli was a nobleman of the Crusader states in the 12th century.\" That is fine. We must ensure no commas. We must also avoid \"Raymond III, Count of Tripoli\" with a comma. So we must write \"Raymond III Count of Tripoli\". Also \"Tripoli Lebanon\" instead of \"Tripoli, Lebanon\". Also \"the Crusader states\" is fine. We must avoid \"the Crusader states, the Kingdom of Jerusalem\" etc. So we must avoid any comma. We must also avoid \"12th century\" with a comma. So we must write \"12th century\" fine. We must avoid \"12th century\" with a comma. So we must not use \"12th century,\". So we must be careful.\n\nWe also need to include at least 3 highlighted parts in markdown. We can include them as separate lines with asterisks. For example:\n\n*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 1*\n*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 2*\n*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 3*\n\nWe must ensure no commas in those lines. They don't have commas. Good.\n\nWe need to produce a summary of more than 300 words. Let's aim for about 350-400 words. We must count words. Let's draft a summary.\n\nWe need to cover: background, family, rule, conflicts, marriage, children, death, significance. We must avoid commas. Let's write sentences with no commas.\n\nWe must also avoid using \"Raymond III, Count of Tripoli\" with a comma. So we will use \"Raymond III Count of Tripoli\". Also \"his father Bohemond III\" no comma. \"his mother Alice of Champagne\" no comma. \"his brother Bohemond IV\" no comma. \"his sister Margaret\" no comma. \"his nephew Bohemond V\" no comma. \"his nephew Raymond\" no comma. \"his nephew Bohemond\" no comma. \"his nephew Bohemond\" no comma. \"his nephew Bohemond\" no comma. \"his nephew Bohemond\" no comma. \"his nephew Bohemond\" no comma.

The user wrote in Thai. They want a summary of more than 300 words. They also want no commas? They say \"อย่าใช้เครื่องหมายจุลภาค\" which means \"do not use commas\". So we must avoid commas. Also they want at least 3 highlighted parts in markdown with asterisks: \"*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 1*\", \"*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 2*\", \"*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 3*\". They want at least 3 parts highlighted in markdown. They want a summary of more than 300 words. They want no commas. That is a challenge: we need to write a long paragraph with no commas. We must avoid commas entirely. That means we cannot use commas in the text. We must be careful. Also we need to include at least 3 highlighted parts. The highlighted parts are \"*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 1*\", \"*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 2*\", \"*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 3*\". They want them in markdown format. So we can include them as bullet points or separate lines. They want at least 3 parts highlighted. We can include them as separate lines. We must not use commas anywhere.

So we need to rewrite sentences without commas. We can use semicolons? But semicolons are punctuation. The instruction says \"อย่าใช้เครื่องหมายจุลภาค\" which means \"do not use commas\". It doesn't forbid semicolons. But we can avoid them too. We can use periods. We can use conjunctions. We can use \"and\" but we must avoid \"and\" with a comma. We can use \"and\" but no comma. So we can write sentences like \"Raymond III Count of Tripoli was a nobleman of the Crusader states in the 12th century.\" That is fine. We must ensure no commas. We must also avoid \"Raymond III, Count of Tripoli\" with a comma. So we must write \"Raymond III Count of Tripoli\". Also \"Tripoli Lebanon\" instead of \"Tripoli, Lebanon\". Also \"the Crusader states\" is fine. We must avoid \"the Crusader states, the Kingdom of Jerusalem\" etc. So we must avoid any comma. We must also avoid \"12th century\" with a comma. So we must write \"12th century\" fine. We must avoid \"12th century\" with a comma. So we must not use \"12th century,\". So we must be careful.\n\nWe also need to include at least 3 highlighted parts in markdown. We can include them as separate lines with asterisks. For example:\n\n*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 1*\n*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 2*\n*ส่วนที่ไฮไลต์ส่วนที่ 3*\n\nWe must ensure no commas in those lines. They don't have commas. Good.\n\nWe need to produce a summary of more than 300 words. Let's aim for about 350-400 words. We must count words. Let's draft a summary.\n\nWe need to cover: background, family, rule, conflicts, marriage, children, death, significance. We must avoid commas. Let's write sentences with no commas.\n\nWe must also avoid using \"Raymond III, Count of Tripoli\" with a comma. So we will use \"Raymond III Count of Tripoli\". Also \"his father Bohemond III\" no comma. \"his mother Alice of Champagne\" no comma. \"his brother Bohemond IV\" no comma. \"his sister Margaret\" no comma. \"his nephew Bohemond V\" no comma. \"his nephew Raymond\" no comma. \"his nephew Bohemond\" no comma. \"his nephew Bohemond\" no comma. \"his nephew Bohemond\" no comma. \"his nephew Bohemond\" no comma. \"his nephew Bohemond\" no comma.
