The correct answer might be \"is holding a rubik's cube\" because it's the only one that doesn't involve the roof. But maybe the question is about a riddle: \"A man is sitting on a roof.

He is \"ripping level tiles off\" maybe he's a roofer. He is \"pulling up roofing on a roof\" also a roofer. So maybe the correct answer is D: starts pulling up roofing on a roof. But the phrase \"on a roof\" is redundant. But maybe it's a trick: \"He starts pulling up roofing on a roof\" is a tautology. But maybe it's the only one that uses the word \"roof\" twice.
