So we need to use markdown formatting for section titles. We need to highlight at least 3 sections. We can use *bold* or *italics*? The example shows *highlighted section part 1* with asterisks.

But we must not use commas. So we need to write a 300+ word summary with no commas. That is a challenge but doable. We need to ensure we don't accidentally use a comma.

So we can use *Raymond III's Early Life* etc. But we need to ensure we don't use commas. So we need to write sentences without commas. We can use semicolons or periods. But we must avoid commas.
