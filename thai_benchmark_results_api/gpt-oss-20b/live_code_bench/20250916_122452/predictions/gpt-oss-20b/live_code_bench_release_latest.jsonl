Observation\n\nAn operation only removes black cells, it never creates new ones.\nTherefore we only have to cover all positions that contain `B`.\n\nIf we look at the leftmost black cell that is still uncovered,\nany operation that removes it must start **at or before** this cell.\nStarting earlier would not cover any new black cell to the left,\nso it can only shift the covered segment to the left and never help us\ncover more black cells on the right.\n\nHence the optimal strategy is:\n\n```\nwhile there is an uncovered black cell\n        take the leftmost one at position i\n        perform an operation on the segment [i , i + k - 1]\n        (i.e. start the segment at i)\n```\n\nAfter this operation all black cells in that segment are removed,\nso we can safely skip to position `i + k` and continue.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm outputs the minimum possible number of\noperations.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nWhen the algorithm processes a black cell at position `i`,\nthere is no optimal solution that uses an operation starting before `i`\nto remove this cell.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nAssume an optimal solution uses an operation that starts at position `j`\nwith `j < i` and covers the cell `i`.  \nBecause the algorithm processes cells from left to right,\nall cells before `i` are already white when the algorithm reaches `i`.  \nThus the operation starting at `j` could be moved to start at `i`\nwithout affecting any other black cell (it would still cover `i`\nand all cells to its right up to `i + k - 1`).  \nThe number of operations stays the same, so the solution is still optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nAfter the algorithm processes a black cell at position `i`,\nall black cells in the segment `[i , i + k - 1]` are removed\nand no later operation of any optimal solution can cover a cell\ninside this segment that the algorithm has already skipped.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe algorithm performs an operation on exactly this segment,\nso all its cells become white.  \nAny later operation must start at a position `≥ i + k`\n(otherwise it would overlap the already processed segment and\ncould be moved leftwards by Lemma&nbsp;1, contradicting optimality).\nHence no later operation can touch a cell inside `[i , i + k - 1]`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nLet `i` be the first index that the algorithm processes.\nThe number of operations performed by the algorithm from index `i`\nto the end of the string is **not larger** than the number of\noperations in any optimal solution.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nWe prove by induction on the remaining length.\n\n*Base:*  \nIf there are no black cells left, both numbers are `0`.\n\n*Induction step:*  \nLet the first uncovered black cell be at position `i`.  \nThe algorithm uses one operation on `[i , i + k - 1]`\nand then continues from `i + k`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 no optimal solution can use an operation that\ncovers a cell inside this segment after the algorithm has moved past it.\nTherefore the optimal solution must also use an operation that covers\nthe cell at `i` (otherwise that cell would stay black forever).\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 we can assume this operation starts at `i`.  \nAfter performing it, the remaining problem is exactly the same as\nthe algorithm’s remaining problem starting at `i + k`.  \nBy the induction hypothesis the algorithm uses no more operations\nthan the optimal solution on this remaining part.  \nAdding the one operation used at the beginning gives the claim. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nFor every test case the algorithm outputs the minimum possible number\nof operations needed to make the whole paper white.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet `A` be the number of operations performed by the algorithm,\nand `O` the number of operations in an optimal solution.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 applied to the whole string we have `A ≤ O`.  \nObviously no algorithm can use fewer operations than an optimal one,\nso `A ≥ O`.  \nThus `A = O`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.  Complexity Analysis\n\nFor each test case we scan the string once.\nAll operations inside the loop are `O(1)`.\n\n```\nTime   :  O(n)   per test case\nMemory :  O(1)   (apart from the input string)\n```\n\nThe sum of `n` over all test cases is at most `2·10^5`,\nwell within the limits.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Observation\n\nAn operation only removes black cells, it never creates new ones.\nTherefore we only have to cover all positions that contain `B`.\n\nIf we look at the leftmost black cell that is still uncovered,\nany operation that removes it must start **at or before** this cell.\nStarting earlier would not cover any new black cell to the left,\nso it can only shift the covered segment to the left and never help us\ncover more black cells on the right.\n\nHence the optimal strategy is:\n\n```\nwhile there is an uncovered black cell\n        take the leftmost one at position i\n        perform an operation on the segment [i , i + k - 1]\n        (i.e. start the segment at i)\n```\n\nAfter this operation all black cells in that segment are removed,\nso we can safely skip to position `i + k` and continue.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm outputs the minimum possible number of\noperations.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nWhen the algorithm processes a black cell at position `i`,\nthere is no optimal solution that uses an operation starting before `i`\nto remove this cell.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nAssume an optimal solution uses an operation that starts at position `j`\nwith `j < i` and covers the cell `i`.  \nBecause the algorithm processes cells from left to right,\nall cells before `i` are already white when the algorithm reaches `i`.  \nThus the operation starting at `j` could be moved to start at `i`\nwithout affecting any other black cell (it would still cover `i`\nand all cells to its right up to `i + k - 1`).  \nThe number of operations stays the same, so the solution is still optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nAfter the algorithm processes a black cell at position `i`,\nall black cells in the segment `[i , i + k - 1]` are removed\nand no later operation of any optimal solution can cover a cell\ninside this segment that the algorithm has already skipped.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe algorithm performs an operation on exactly this segment,\nso all its cells become white.  \nAny later operation must start at a position `≥ i + k`\n(otherwise it would overlap the already processed segment and\ncould be moved leftwards by Lemma&nbsp;1, contradicting optimality).\nHence no later operation can touch a cell inside `[i , i + k - 1]`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nLet `i` be the first index that the algorithm processes.\nThe number of operations performed by the algorithm from index `i`\nto the end of the string is **not larger** than the number of\noperations in any optimal solution.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nWe prove by induction on the remaining length.\n\n*Base:*  \nIf there are no black cells left, both numbers are `0`.\n\n*Induction step:*  \nLet the first uncovered black cell be at position `i`.  \nThe algorithm uses one operation on `[i , i + k - 1]`\nand then continues from `i + k`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 no optimal solution can use an operation that\ncovers a cell inside this segment after the algorithm has moved past it.\nTherefore the optimal solution must also use an operation that covers\nthe cell at `i` (otherwise that cell would stay black forever).\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 we can assume this operation starts at `i`.  \nAfter performing it, the remaining problem is exactly the same as\nthe algorithm’s remaining problem starting at `i + k`.  \nBy the induction hypothesis the algorithm uses no more operations\nthan the optimal solution on this remaining part.  \nAdding the one operation used at the beginning gives the claim. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nFor every test case the algorithm outputs the minimum possible number\nof operations needed to make the whole paper white.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet `A` be the number of operations performed by the algorithm,\nand `O` the number of operations in an optimal solution.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 applied to the whole string we have `A ≤ O`.  \nObviously no algorithm can use fewer operations than an optimal one,\nso `A ≥ O`.  \nThus `A = O`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Equivalent: after deletion, the multiset of remaining characters must have at most one character with odd count. Because palindrome rearrangement condition: at most one odd count.\n\nLet original counts: freq[26]. We can delete k characters arbitrarily. We want to choose a multiset of deletions such that remaining counts satisfy palindrome condition. Equivalent: we can reduce counts by some amounts (nonnegative integers) summing to k, resulting in new counts c_i = freq_i - d_i. Need at most one odd among c_i.\n\nWe can think of parity changes: deleting a character flips parity of that character. So we can choose to flip parity of some characters by deleting an odd number of that character. But also we can delete even number to keep parity same. But we also need to reduce total sum by k.\n\nGoal: find if there exists a set of deletions such that after deletion, number of odd counts <=1.\n\nLet initial odd count = O. We can reduce O by deleting characters. Each deletion of a character of a type with odd count reduces that count by 1, making it even. So each such deletion reduces O by 1. Deleting from an even count keeps O same. But we can also delete two from odd count: first deletion reduces O by1, second deletion increases O by1? Wait: if we delete two from odd count: first deletion makes it even (O-1), second deletion makes it odd again (O). So net effect 0. So only odd number of deletions from a type changes parity. So we can choose to delete any number of characters, but parity changes only depend on parity of deletions per type.\n\nThus we can choose to reduce O to any value <= O by deleting at least O - target odd count characters from odd types, each deletion reduces O by 1. But we also need to delete exactly k characters. So we need to find if there exists a target odd count t (0 or 1) such that we can delete exactly k characters and end with t odd counts.\n\nLet we delete x characters from odd types (each deletion reduces O by 1). Let y characters from even types (parity unchanged). Then total deletions k = x + y. After deletions, odd count = O - x. We need O - x <=1. So x >= O-1. Also x <= O (can't delete more than O odd types? Actually we can delete more than O from odd types, but each additional deletion from odd types will toggle parity back, so x can be any integer >=0, but parity of remaining odd count is O - x mod 2? Wait: if we delete 2 from an odd type, parity unchanged. So x can be any integer, but the parity of O - x is O - x mod 2? Actually each deletion toggles parity, so after x deletions from odd types, parity of that type toggles x times. So net parity change is x mod 2. So overall odd count after deletions = O - (number of odd types from which we deleted odd number of times). But if we delete even number from an odd type, parity unchanged. So we can choose which odd types to delete odd number of times. So we can reduce O by any number up to O, but we can also keep some odd counts. So we can achieve any odd count between 0 and O inclusive, but parity of difference? Actually we can reduce O by any integer d where 0 <= d <= O, because we can choose d odd types to delete odd number of times. So we can reduce O to O-d. So we can achieve any odd count between 0 and O. So we can aim for t=0 or 1. So we need to find if we can delete k characters such that we reduce O to <=1.\n\nLet we need to reduce O to t (0 or 1). So we need to delete at least O - t characters from odd types. Let d = O - t. We need to delete at least d from odd types. The rest of deletions can be from any types (odd or even) as long as we don't change parity beyond desired. But we can delete extra characters from odd types in pairs (even number) to keep parity same. So we can delete any number >= d as long as we can adjust parity.\n\nThus condition: k >= d, and (k - d) can be any number? We can delete extra characters from any types, but we must ensure we don't change parity beyond t. If we delete extra from odd types in pairs, parity unchanged. If we delete from even types any number, parity unchanged. So any extra deletions are fine. So condition is simply k >= d. But also we cannot delete more than total characters n. But k < n given. So fine.\n\nThus answer YES if k >= O - 1 (since t can be 1). But also we need to consider t=0 possibility: k >= O. But if k >= O-1, we can achieve t=1. But if O=0, we already have palindrome. Need k >=0? But we must delete exactly k. If O=0, we need to delete k characters but keep palindrome property. We can delete any characters as long as we keep at most one odd. Since O=0, we can delete any number of characters as long as we don't create odd counts. But deleting from even types any number keeps even. Deleting from odd types (none) would create odd. So we must delete only from even types. But if all types are even, we can delete any number of characters as long as we delete even number from each type? Wait: if we delete one from an even type, it becomes odd, increasing O to 1. That's allowed because t=1. So we can delete any number of characters, but we must ensure final odd <=1. So if we delete odd number from an even type, we get odd count 1. If we delete even number from even type, parity unchanged. So we can delete any number of characters as long as we don't create more than one odd. So we can delete any k? Let's test: Suppose string \"aa\" (freq a=2). O=0. k=1. Delete one 'a', remaining 'a', O=1. OK. k=2: delete both, remaining empty string, O=0. OK. So any k works. So condition k >= O-1 holds: O-1 = -1, so always true. So answer YES.\n\nEdge: O=1. Then O-1=0. So any k>=0 works? Let's test: string \"ab\" (a=1,b=1). O=2. Wait O=2. For O=1, e.g., \"aab\" (a=2,b=1). O=1. k=1. Can we delete 1 char to keep palindrome? We can delete 'b', remaining \"aa\" palindrome. Yes. k=2: delete 'b' and one 'a', remaining \"a\" palindrome. Yes. k=3: delete all, empty palindrome. Yes. So any k works. So condition holds.\n\nThus answer is YES if k >= O-1. But also we need to ensure that we can delete exactly k characters. Is there any upper bound? We cannot delete more than n. k < n. So fine.\n\nBut is there any case where k >= O-1 but impossible? Let's test: string \"abc\" (a,b,c each 1). O=3. O-1=2. k=2: can we delete 2 chars to get palindrome? We need remaining length 1. Yes, delete any two, remaining one char palindrome. k=3: delete all, empty palindrome. k=1: k<2, so NO. Indeed sample: 3 2 abc -> YES. 3 1 abc -> YES? Wait sample: 3 1 abc -> YES. Wait sample says 3 1 abc -> YES. Let's check: n=3,k=1, s=abc. O=3. O-1=2. k=1<2, but sample says YES. So our condition fails. Let's analyze: We can delete 1 char, remaining 2 chars. Can we rearrange to palindrome? Need at most one odd. Remaining two chars could be same or different. If we delete 'a', remaining \"bc\" (b=1,c=1) O=2 >1. Not palindrome. Delete 'b', remaining \"ac\" O=2. Delete 'c', remaining \"ab\" O=2. So no. But sample says YES. Wait sample input: \"3 1 abc\" -> output YES. Let's double-check sample: Provided sample lines: 3 1 abc -> YES. But maybe I misread. Let's re-evaluate: The sample input lines:\n\n1 0 a -> YES\n2 0 ab -> NO\n2 1 ba -> YES\n3 1 abb -> YES\n3 2 abc -> YES\n6 2 bacacd -> YES\n6 2 fagbza -> NO\n6 2 zwaafa -> NO\n7 2 taagaak -> YES\n14 3 ttrraakkttoorr -> YES\n5 3 debdb -> YES\n5 4 ecadc -> YES\n5 3 debca -> NO\n5 3 abaac -> YES\n\nWait \"3 1 abc\" is not in sample. The sample had \"3 2 abc\". So no conflict.\n\nThus condition seems correct.\n\nBut let's test edge: string \"ab\" O=2. k=1. O-1=1. k>=1 => YES. Can we delete 1 char to get palindrome? Delete 'a', remaining 'b' palindrome. Yes.\n\nString \"abc\" O=3. k=2. O-1=2. k>=2 => YES. Delete 'a','b', remaining 'c' palindrome. Yes.\n\nString \"abc\" k=1. O-1=2, k<2 => NO. Indeed cannot.\n\nThus condition seems correct.\n\nBut we must also consider that we cannot delete more than available of each type. But we can delete any number up to freq. Since k < n, we can always delete k characters. So no issue.\n\nThus algorithm: For each test case, compute O = number of characters with odd frequency. If k >= O-1, print YES else NO.\n\nEdge: O=0 => O-1 = -1 => always true. So always YES.\n\nEdge: O=1 => O-1=0 => always true.\n\nEdge: O=2 => O-1=1 => k>=1 => YES if k>=1 else NO. For n>k. For example n=2,k=0, s=\"ab\" O=2, k=0<1 => NO. Correct.\n\nThus solution.\n\nComplexity: O(n) per test.\n\nLet's implement.\n\nCheck sample: We'll test some.\n\nTest: n=6,k=2,s=bacacd. freq: a:2,b:1,c:2,d:1. O=2 (b,d). O-1=1. k=2>=1 => YES.

O-1=3. k=2<3 => NO. Sample NO.\n\nTest: n=7,k=2,s=taagaak. freq: t:1,a:4,g:1,k:1. O: t,g,k =3. O-1=2. k=2>=2 => YES. Sample YES.\n\nTest: n=14,k=3,s=ttrraakkttoorr. freq: t:4,r:4,a:2,k:2. O=0. O-1=-1. k>=-1 => YES. Sample YES.\n\nTest: n=5,k=3,s=debdb. freq: d:2,e:1,b:2. O=1. O-1=0. k>=0 => YES. Sample YES.\n\nTest: n=5,k=4,s=ecadc. freq: e:2,c:2,a:1,d:1. O=2. O-1=1. k=4>=1 => YES. Sample YES.\n\nTest: n=5,k=3,s=debca. freq: d:1,e:1,b:1,c:1,a:1. O=5. O-1=4. k=3<4 => NO. Sample NO.\n\nTest: n=5,k=3,s=abaac. freq: a:3,b:1,c:1. O=3. O-1=2. k=3>=2 => YES. Sample YES.\n\nAll match.\n\nThus implement.\n\nEdge: k can be 0. Then condition: k>=O-1. If O=0 => -1 => true. If O=1 => 0 => true. If O>=2 => need k>=O-1 >=1 => false. So if k=0 and O>=2 => NO. That matches: cannot delete any char, so string must already be palindrome. Palindrome condition: O<=1. So correct.\n\nThus final.\n\nImplementation: read t, loop. For each, read n,k, read s. Count freq via collections.Counter or array of size 26. Compute O. If k >= O-1: print YES else NO.\n\nTime complexity fine.\n\nLet's produce code.", "signature": null, "redacted": false}, {"internal": null, "type": "text", "text": "```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve() -> None:\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    it = iter(data)\n    t = int(next(it))\n    out_lines = []\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(next(it))\n        k = int(next(it))\n        s = next(it)\n        freq = [0] * 26\n        for ch in s:\n            freq[ord(ch) - 97] += 1\n        odd_cnt = sum(1 for f in freq if f % 2 == 1)\n        # We can achieve a palindrome if we can delete at least odd_cnt - 1 characters\n        if k >= odd_cnt - 1:\n            out_lines.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            out_lines.append(\"NO\")\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(out_lines))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "refusal": null}], "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "gpt-oss-20b"}, "stop_reason": "stop", "logprobs": null}], "usage": {"input_tokens": 823, "output_tokens": 3147, "total_tokens": 3970, "input_tokens_cache_write": null, "input_tokens_cache_read": null, "reasoning_tokens": null}, "time": null, "metadata": null, "error": null}, "messages": [{"id": "d6c12e7f", "content": [{"internal": null, "type": "reasoning", "reasoning": "We need to determine if we can delete exactly k characters so that remaining can be rearranged into palindrome.

Wait: if we delete one from an even type, it becomes odd, increasing O to 1. That's allowed because t=1. So we can delete any number of characters, but we must ensure final odd <=1. So if we delete odd number from an even type, we get odd count 1. If we delete even number from even type, parity unchanged. So we can delete any number of characters as long as we don't create more than one odd. So we can delete any k? Let's test: Suppose string \"aa\" (freq a=2). O=0. k=1. Delete one 'a', remaining 'a', O=1. OK. k=2: delete both, remaining empty string, O=0. OK. So any k works. So condition k >= O-1 holds: O-1 = -1, so always true. So answer YES.\n\nEdge: O=1. Then O-1=0. So any k>=0 works? Let's test: string \"ab\" (a=1,b=1). O=2. Wait O=2. For O=1, e.g., \"aab\" (a=2,b=1). O=1. k=1. Can we delete 1 char to keep palindrome? We can delete 'b', remaining \"aa\" palindrome. Yes. k=2: delete 'b' and one 'a', remaining \"a\" palindrome. Yes. k=3: delete all, empty palindrome. Yes. So any k works. So condition holds.\n\nThus answer is YES if k >= O-1. But also we need to ensure that we can delete exactly k characters. Is there any upper bound? We cannot delete more than n. k < n. So fine.\n\nBut is there any case where k >= O-1 but impossible? Let's test: string \"abc\" (a,b,c each 1). O=3. O-1=2. k=2: can we delete 2 chars to get palindrome? We need remaining length 1. Yes, delete any two, remaining one char palindrome. k=3: delete all, empty palindrome. k=1: k<2, so NO. Indeed sample: 3 2 abc -> YES. 3 1 abc -> YES? Wait sample: 3 1 abc -> YES. Wait sample says 3 1 abc -> YES. Let's check: n=3,k=1, s=abc. O=3. O-1=2. k=1<2, but sample says YES. So our condition fails. Let's analyze: We can delete 1 char, remaining 2 chars. Can we rearrange to palindrome? Need at most one odd. Remaining two chars could be same or different. If we delete 'a', remaining \"bc\" (b=1,c=1) O=2 >1. Not palindrome. Delete 'b', remaining \"ac\" O=2. Delete 'c', remaining \"ab\" O=2. So no. But sample says YES. Wait sample input: \"3 1 abc\" -> output YES. Let's double-check sample: Provided sample lines: 3 1 abc -> YES. But maybe I misread. Let's re-evaluate: The sample input lines:\n\n1 0 a -> YES\n2 0 ab -> NO\n2 1 ba -> YES\n3 1 abb -> YES\n3 2 abc -> YES\n6 2 bacacd -> YES\n6 2 fagbza -> NO\n6 2 zwaafa -> NO\n7 2 taagaak -> YES\n14 3 ttrraakkttoorr -> YES\n5 3 debdb -> YES\n5 4 ecadc -> YES\n5 3 debca -> NO\n5 3 abaac -> YES\n\nWait \"3 1 abc\" is not in sample. The sample had \"3 2 abc\". So no conflict.\n\nThus condition seems correct.\n\nBut let's test edge: string \"ab\" O=2. k=1. O-1=1. k>=1 => YES. Can we delete 1 char to get palindrome? Delete 'a', remaining 'b' palindrome. Yes.\n\nString \"abc\" O=3. k=2. O-1=2. k>=2 => YES. Delete 'a','b', remaining 'c' palindrome. Yes.\n\nString \"abc\" k=1. O-1=2, k<2 => NO. Indeed cannot.\n\nThus condition seems correct.\n\nBut we must also consider that we cannot delete more than available of each type. But we can delete any number up to freq. Since k < n, we can always delete k characters. So no issue.\n\nThus algorithm: For each test case, compute O = number of characters with odd frequency. If k >= O-1, print YES else NO.\n\nEdge: O=0 => O-1 = -1 => always true. So always YES.\n\nEdge: O=1 => O-1=0 => always true.\n\nEdge: O=2 => O-1=1 => k>=1 => YES if k>=1 else NO. For n>k. For example n=2,k=0, s=\"ab\" O=2, k=0<1 => NO. Correct.\n\nThus solution.\n\nComplexity: O(n) per test.\n\nLet's implement.\n\nCheck sample: We'll test some.\n\nTest: n=6,k=2,s=bacacd. freq: a:2,b:1,c:2,d:1. O=2 (b,d). O-1=1. k=2>=1 => YES. Sample says YES.\n\nTest: n=6,k=2,s=fagbza. freq: f:1,a:2,g:1,b:1,z:1. O: f,g,b,z =4. O-1=3. k=2<3 => NO. Sample NO.\n\nTest: n=6,k=2,s=zwaafa. freq: z:1,w:1,a:3,f:1. O: z,w,a,f =4. O-1=3. k=2<3 => NO. Sample NO.\n\nTest: n=7,k=2,s=taagaak. freq: t:1,a:4,g:1,k:1. O: t,g,k =3. O-1=2. k=2>=2 => YES. Sample YES.\n\nTest: n=14,k=3,s=ttrraakkttoorr. freq: t:4,r:4,a:2,k:2. O=0. O-1=-1. k>=-1 => YES. Sample YES.\n\nTest: n=5,k=3,s=debdb. freq: d:2,e:1,b:2. O=1. O-1=0. k>=0 => YES. Sample YES.\n\nTest: n=5,k=4,s=ecadc. freq: e:2,c:2,a:1,d:1. O=2. O-1=1. k=4>=1 => YES. Sample YES.\n\nTest: n=5,k=3,s=debca. freq: d:1,e:1,b:1,c:1,a:1. O=5. O-1=4. k=3<4 => NO. Sample NO.\n\nTest: n=5,k=3,s=abaac. freq: a:3,b:1,c:1. O=3. O-1=2. k=3>=2 => YES. Sample YES.\n\nAll match.\n\nThus implement.\n\nEdge: k can be 0. Then condition: k>=O-1. If O=0 => -1 => true. If O=1 => 0 => true. If O>=2 => need k>=O-1 >=1 => false. So if k=0 and O>=2 => NO. That matches: cannot delete any char, so string must already be palindrome. Palindrome condition: O<=1. So correct.\n\nThus final.\n\nImplementation: read t, loop. For each, read n,k, read s. Count freq via collections.Counter or array of size 26. Compute O. If k >= O-1: print YES else NO.\n\nTime complexity fine.\n\nLet's produce code.", "signature": null, "redacted": false}, {"internal": null, "type": "text", "text": "```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve() -> None:\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    it = iter(data)\n    t = int(next(it))\n    out_lines = []\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(next(it))\n        k = int(next(it))\n        s = next(it)\n        freq = [0] * 26\n        for ch in s:\n            freq[ord(ch) - 97] += 1\n        odd_cnt = sum(1 for f in freq if f % 2 == 1)\n        # We can achieve a palindrome if we can delete at least odd_cnt - 1 characters\n        if k >= odd_cnt - 1:\n            out_lines.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            out_lines.append(\"NO\")\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(out_lines))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "refusal": null}], "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "gpt-oss-20b"}], "metadata": {}}

Operation: increment any element by 1. Want minimal operations to make product divisible by k.\n\nObservation: product divisible by k means that at least one prime factor of k is present in product with required multiplicity. Since k <=5, primes are 2,3,5. For k=2,3,4,5. For k=4=2^2. For k=5 prime. For k=2 prime. For k=3 prime. For k=5 prime. For k=4 need two factors of 2.\n\nWe can think of each element's value modulo k? Actually we need to ensure product mod k ==0. Equivalent to product has factor k. Since k small, we can brute force minimal increments.\n\nWe can think of each element's value modulo k, but increments change value by 1 each time. We can consider each element's residue mod k. For k prime, we need at least one element that becomes divisible by k after some increments. For k=4, need at least two elements divisible by 2? Wait product divisible by 4 means product has at least two factors of 2. That could come from one element divisible by 4, or two elements each divisible by 2. Since we can increment elements, we can adjust.\n\nSimpler: Since a_i <=10, after increments they can become arbitrarily large. But we only need minimal increments. We can consider each element's value modulo k and also its factorization of 2 and 3 and 5.\n\nBut maybe easier: Since k <=5, we can brute force over all possible increments up to some small bound? But n up to 1e5, can't brute per element.\n\nWe can think of dynamic programming: we need to achieve product divisible by k. Equivalent to product's prime exponents sum >= required exponents. For k=2: need at least one element with factor 2. For k=3: need at least one element with factor 3. For k=5: need at least one element with factor 5. For k=4: need sum of exponents of 2 >=2.\n\nThus we can compute for each element the minimal increments to make it divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 4? Actually we need minimal increments to make element divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 4. But for k=4, we need two 2's. So we can consider two scenarios: either one element becomes divisible by 4, or two elements become divisible by 2.\n\nWe can compute for each element the minimal increments to reach a number divisible by 2, 3, 5, 4. Since a_i <=10, we can precompute for each value 1..10 the minimal increments to reach each target.\n\nLet's precompute for each v in 1..10, for each target t in {2,3,4,5} minimal increments d such that (v + d) % t == 0. That's simply (t - v % t) % t. But careful: if v % t == 0, d=0. So d = (t - v % t) % t.\n\nThus for each element we know d2, d3, d4, d5.\n\nNow for k=2: answer = min over i of d2. Because we can increment one element to be divisible by 2. But we also could increment multiple elements? But minimal is just min d2.\n\nSimilarly for k=3: min d3.\n\nFor k=5: min d5.\n\nFor k=4: we need either one element divisible by 4: min d4. Or two elements divisible by 2: we need two smallest d2 values. So answer = min(min d4, sum of two smallest d2). Because we can choose two elements and increment each accordingly.\n\nEdge case: if n=1? But n>=2.\n\nThus algorithm: For each test case, read n,k, array. Compute d2,d3,d4,d5 for each element. For k=2,3,5: answer = min d_k. For k=4: compute min_d4, and get two smallest d2. answer = min(min_d4, d2_1 + d2_2). Complexity O(n). Works.\n\nLet's test with sample? Let's quickly test mentally: first test: n=2,k=5, a=[7,3]. d5 for 7: (5-7%5)= (5-2)=3? Wait 7%5=2, so d5=3. For 3: 3%5=3, d5=2. min=2. Output 2 matches.\n\nSecond test: n=3,k=3, a=[7,4,1]. d3: 7%3=1 => d3=2. 4%3=1 => d3=2. 1%3=1 => d3=2. min=2. Output 2 matches.\n\nThird: n=5,k=2, a=[9,7,7,3,9]. d2: 9%2=1 => d2=1. 7%2=1 =>1. 7%2=1 =>1. 3%2=1 =>1. 9%2=1 =>1. min=1. Output 1 matches.\n\nFourth: n=5,k=5, a=[5,4,1,2,3]. d5: 5%5=0 =>0. So min=0.

Output 0 matches.\n\nTenth: n=3,k=4, a=[3,5,3]. d4: 3%4=3 =>1. 5%4=1 =>3. 3%4=3 =>1. min d4=1. d2: 3%2=1 =>1. 5%2=1 =>1. 3%2=1 =>1. two smallest sum=1+1=2. min=1.

But Vanya starts, so moves: 1 Vanya, 2 Vova, 3 Vanya, 4 Vova, 5 Vanya, 6 Vova, 7 Vanya, 8 Vova, 9 Vanya, 10 Vova. After Vanya's move, check win. So Vanya has moves 1,3,5,7,9. He can win on any of those if after his move number divisible by 3. Vova's moves don't have win condition. If after 10 moves Vanya hasn't won, Vova wins.\n\nBoth play optimally.

After his move, if divisible by 3, he wins immediately. If not, Vova moves similarly. Vova's goal is to avoid giving Vanya a divisible by 3 on his next move. But Vova cannot win directly; he just wants to survive until 10 moves.\n\nWe can analyze modulo 3. Since adding or subtracting 1 changes modulo by ±1 mod 3. So each move toggles modulo by ±1. Let's denote current modulo m (0,1,2). Vanya wants to reach 0 on his move. Vova wants to avoid that.\n\nWe can think of game as a sequence of 10 moves. Let's simulate optimal play. Since both can choose ±1, they can control modulo. Let's analyze from Vanya's perspective: On his turn, if current m is 1 or 2, he can move to m-1 or m+1 mod3. He can choose to move to 0 if possible: if m=1, moving -1 gives 0; if m=2, moving +1 gives 0. So if at Vanya's turn, m is 1 or 2, he can win immediately. So Vanya will win if at any of his turns the current modulo is not 0. But if it's 0 at his turn, he cannot win immediately because moving ±1 will change modulo to 1 or 2, not 0. So he cannot win on that turn. So the only way Vanya can win is if at some Vanya turn, the current modulo is 1 or 2. But that's almost always unless the starting n is such that after Vova's moves, the modulo becomes 0 at Vanya's turn. But Vova can try to force modulo 0 at Vanya's turns.\n\nLet's analyze: Starting n has modulo m0. Vanya's first move: if m0 is 1 or 2, he can win immediately. So if n mod 3 != 0, Vanya wins on first move. If n mod 3 == 0, Vanya cannot win immediately. He must move to m=1 or 2. He will choose one that gives best chance. Suppose n mod 3 = 0. Vanya moves to either 1 or 2. Let's say he moves to 1 (by subtracting 1). Then Vova's turn with m=1. Vova wants to avoid giving Vanya a winning position. If m=1 at Vova's turn, Vova can move to m=0 or m=2. If he moves to 0, then Vanya's next turn will have m=0, which is not winning. If he moves to 2, Vanya's next turn will have m=2, which is winning. So Vova will move to 0. Similarly if Vanya had moved to 2, Vova would move to 0. So after Vova's move, m=0. Then Vanya's next turn has m=0, cannot win. He must move to 1 or 2. He will choose one, say 1. Then Vova again moves to 0. So pattern: if starting m=0, Vanya cannot win on his first move, and Vova can always respond to bring m back to 0 after his move. So Vanya will never get a turn with m=1 or 2. Thus Vanya cannot win. So Vova wins.\n\nThus the result: If n mod 3 == 0, Vova wins; else Vanya wins.

minSum` computed by the\nalgorithm equals the maximum absolute difference between the weights of\nany two trucks of size `k`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet `Smin` and `Smax` be the minimum and maximum truck weights for\nsize `k`.  \nFor any two trucks with weights `x` and `y` we have\n\n```\n|x -
