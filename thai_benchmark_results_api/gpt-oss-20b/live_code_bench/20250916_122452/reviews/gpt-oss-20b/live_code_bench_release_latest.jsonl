Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm outputs the minimum possible number of\noperations.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nWhen the algorithm processes a black cell at position `i`,\nthere is no optimal solution that uses an operation starting before `i`\nto remove this cell.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nAssume an optimal solution uses an operation that starts at position `j`\nwith `j < i` and covers the cell `i`.  \nBecause the algorithm processes cells from left to right,\nall cells before `i` are already white when the algorithm reaches `i`.  \nThus the operation starting at `j` could be moved to start at `i`\nwithout affecting any other black cell (it would still cover `i`\nand all cells to its right up to `i + k - 1`).  \nThe number of operations stays the same, so the solution is still optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nAfter the algorithm processes a black cell at position `i`,\nall black cells in the segment `[i , i + k - 1]` are removed\nand no later operation of any optimal solution can cover a cell\ninside this segment that the algorithm has already skipped.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe algorithm performs an operation on exactly this segment,\nso all its cells become white.  \nAny later operation must start at a position `≥ i + k`\n(otherwise it would overlap the already processed segment and\ncould be moved leftwards by Lemma&nbsp;1, contradicting optimality).\nHence no later operation can touch a cell inside `[i , i + k - 1]`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nLet `i` be the first index that the algorithm processes.\nThe number of operations performed by the algorithm from index `i`\nto the end of the string is **not larger** than the number of\noperations in any optimal solution.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nWe prove by induction on the remaining length.\n\n*Base:*  \nIf there are no black cells left, both numbers are `0`.\n\n*Induction step:*  \nLet the first uncovered black cell be at position `i`.  \nThe algorithm uses one operation on `[i , i + k - 1]`\nand then continues from `i + k`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 no optimal solution can use an operation that\ncovers a cell inside this segment after the algorithm has moved past it.\nTherefore the optimal solution must also use an operation that covers\nthe cell at `i` (otherwise that cell would stay black forever).\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 we can assume this operation starts at `i`.  \nAfter performing it, the remaining problem is exactly the same as\nthe algorithm’s remaining problem starting at `i + k`.  \nBy the induction hypothesis the algorithm uses no more operations\nthan the optimal solution on this remaining part.  \nAdding the one operation used at the beginning gives the claim. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nFor every test case the algorithm outputs the minimum possible number\nof operations needed to make the whole paper white.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet `A` be the number of operations performed by the algorithm,\nand `O` the number of operations in an optimal solution.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 applied to the whole string we have `A ≤ O`.  \nObviously no algorithm can use fewer operations than an optimal one,\nso `A ≥ O`.  \nThus `A = O`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.  Complexity Analysis\n\nFor each test case we scan the string once.\nAll operations inside the loop are `O(1)`.\n\n```\nTime   :  O(n)   per test case\nMemory :  O(1)   (apart from the input string)\n```\n\nThe sum of `n` over all test cases is at most `2·10^5`,\nwell within the limits.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

minSum` computed by the\nalgorithm equals the maximum absolute difference between the weights of\nany two trucks of size `k`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet `Smin` and `Smax` be the minimum and maximum truck weights for\nsize `k`.  \nFor any two trucks with weights `x` and `y` we have\n\n```\n|x - y| ≤ max(x, y) - min(x, y) ≤ Smax - Smin\n```\n\nEquality is achieved by the trucks with weights `Smin` and `Smax`.  \nThus the maximum possible absolute difference equals `Smax - Smin`,\nwhich is exactly what the algorithm computes. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every divisor `k` of `n` the algorithm considers the value\n`maxSum -

He likes electronic music most of all, so he has created his own system of music notes, which, in his opinion, is best for it.\n\nSince Yarik also likes informatics, in his system notes are denoted by integers of $2^k$, where $k \\ge 1$ — a positive integer. But, as you know, you can't use just notes to write music, so Yarik uses combinations of two notes. The combination of two notes $(a, b)$, where $a = 2^k$ and $b = 2^l$, he denotes by the integer $a^b$.\n\nFor example, if $a = 8 = 2^3$, $b = 4 = 2^2$, then the combination $(a, b)$ is denoted by the integer $a^b = 8^4 = 4096$. Note that different combinations can have the same notation, e.g., the combination $(64, 2)$ is also denoted by the integer $4096 = 64^2$.\n\nYarik has already chosen $n$ notes that he wants to use in his new melody. However, since their integers can be very large, he has written them down as an array $a$ of length $n$, then the note $i$ is $b_i = 2^{a_i}$. The integers in array $a$ can be repeated.\n\nThe melody will consist of several combinations of two notes. Yarik was wondering how many pairs of notes $b_i, b_j$ $(i < j)$ exist such that the combination $(b_i, b_j)$ is equal to the combination $(b_j, b_i)$. In other words, he wants to count the number of pairs $(i, j)$ $(i < j)$ such that $b_i^{b_j} = b_j^{b_i}$. Help him find the number of such pairs.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$) — the length of the arrays.\n\nThe next line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$) — array $a$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the number of pairs that satisfy the given condition.Sample Input 1:\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3 1 3 2\n\n2\n\n1000 1000\n\n3\n\n1 1 1\n\n19\n\n2 4 1 6 2 8 5 4 2 10 5 10 8 7 4 3 2 6 10\n\n\n\nSample Output 1:\n\n0\n2\n1\n3\n19\n\n\n### Format: Read the inputs from stdin solve the problem and write the answer to stdout (do not directly test on the sample inputs).
