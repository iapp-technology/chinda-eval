{"index": 6, "input": "**User**: \n### Question:\nAlex is participating in the filming of another video of BrMeast, and BrMeast asked Alex to prepare 250 thousand tons of TNT, but Alex didn't hear him well, so he prepared $n$ boxes and arranged them in a row waiting for trucks. The $i$-th box from the left weighs $a_i$ tons.\n\nAll trucks that Alex is going to use hold the same number of boxes, denoted by $k$. Loading happens the following way:\n\n \n-  The first $k$ boxes goes to the first truck, \n-  The second $k$ boxes goes to the second truck, \n-  $\\dotsb$ \n-  The last $k$ boxes goes to the $\\frac{n}{k}$-th truck. Upon loading is completed, each truck must have exactly $k$ boxes. In other words, if at some point it is not possible to load exactly $k$ boxes into the truck, then the loading option with that $k$ is not possible.\n\nAlex hates justice, so he wants the maximum absolute difference between the total weights of two trucks to be as great as possible. If there is only one truck, this value is $0$.\n\nAlex has quite a lot of connections, so for every $1 \\leq k \\leq n$, he can find a company such that each of its trucks can hold exactly $k$ boxes. Print the maximum absolute difference between the total weights of any two trucks.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 150\\,000$) — the number of boxes.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$) — the weights of the boxes.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ for all test cases does not exceed $150\\,000$.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer — the answer to the problem.Sample Input 1:\n5\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n6\n\n10 2 3 6 1 3\n\n4\n\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n\n15\n\n60978 82265 78961 56708 39846 31071 4913 4769 29092 91348 64119 72421 98405 222 14294\n\n8\n\n19957 69913 37531 96991 57838 21008 14207 19198\n\n\n\nSample Output 1:\n\n1\n9\n0\n189114\n112141\n\n\nNote\n\nIn the first case, we should pick two trucks, so the first one will have only the first box, and the second one will have only the second box.\n\nIn the second case, we should pick six trucks, so the maximum will be $10$, the minimum will be $1$, and the answer is $10 - 1 = 9$.\n\nIn the third case, for any possible $k$, the trucks will have the same total weight of boxes, so the answer is $0$.\n\n### Format: Read the inputs from stdin solve the problem and write the answer to stdout (do not directly test on the sample inputs).

{"index": 8, "input": "**User**: \n### Question:\nYarik is a big fan of many kinds of music. But Yarik loves not only listening to music but also writing it. He likes electronic music most of all, so he has created his own system of music notes, which, in his opinion, is best for it.\n\nSince Yarik also likes informatics, in his system notes are denoted by integers of $2^k$, where $k \\ge 1$ — a positive integer. But, as you know, you can't use just notes to write music, so Yarik uses combinations of two notes. The combination of two notes $(a, b)$, where $a = 2^k$ and $b = 2^l$, he denotes by the integer $a^b$.\n\nFor example, if $a = 8 = 2^3$, $b = 4 = 2^2$, then the combination $(a, b)$ is denoted by the integer $a^b = 8^4 = 4096$. Note that different combinations can have the same notation, e.g., the combination $(64, 2)$ is also denoted by the integer $4096 = 64^2$.\n\nYarik has already chosen $n$ notes that he wants to use in his new melody. However, since their integers can be very large, he has written them down as an array $a$ of length $n$, then the note $i$ is $b_i = 2^{a_i}$. The integers in array $a$ can be repeated.\n\nThe melody will consist of several combinations of two notes. Yarik was wondering how many pairs of notes $b_i, b_j$ $(i < j)$ exist such that the combination $(b_i, b_j)$ is equal to the combination $(b_j, b_i)$. In other words, he wants to count the number of pairs $(i, j)$ $(i < j)$ such that $b_i^{b_j} = b_j^{b_i}$.

The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 6, and we can show that 6 is the maximum we can obtain.\n\nFor the 2nd query x_i = 1 and y_i = 3, we can select index j = 2 since nums1[j] >= 1 and nums2[j] >= 3.

We can start by selecting the character 'a' at index 1. We then remove the closest 'a' to the left of index 1, which is at index 0, and the closest 'a' to the right of index 1, which is at index 2. After this operation, the string becomes \"abc\". Any further operation we perform on the string will leave it unchanged. Therefore, the length of the minimized string is 3.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"cbbd\"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: For this we can start with character 'b' at index 1. There is no occurrence of 'b' to the left of index 1, but there is one to the right at index 2, so we delete the 'b' at index 2. The string becomes \"cbd\" and further operations will leave it unchanged. Hence, the minimized length is 3. \n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"dddaaa\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: For this, we can start with the character 'd' at index 1. The closest occurrence of a 'd' to its left is at index 0, and the closest occurrence of a 'd' to its right is at index 2. We delete both index 0 and 2, so the string becomes \"daaa\". In the new string, we can select the character 'a' at index 2. The closest occurrence of an 'a' to its left is at index 1, and the closest occurrence of an 'a' to its right is at index 3. We delete both of them, and the string becomes \"da\".

Then follows the description of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$, $2 \\leq k \\leq 5$) — the size of the array $a$ and the number $k$.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of operations needed to make the product of all the numbers in the array divisible by $k$.Sample Input 1:\n15\n\n2 5\n\n7 3\n\n3 3\n\n7 4 1\n\n5 2\n\n9 7 7 3 9\n\n5 5\n\n5 4 1 2 3\n\n7 4\n\n9 5 1 5 9 5 1\n\n3 4\n\n6 3 6\n\n3 4\n\n6 1 5\n\n3 4\n\n1 5 9\n\n4 4\n\n1 4 1 1\n\n3 4\n\n3 5 3\n\n4 5\n\n8 9 9 3\n\n2 5\n\n1 6\n\n2 5\n\n10 10\n\n4 5\n\n1 6 1 1\n\n2 5\n\n7 7\n\n\n\nSample Output 1:\n\n2\n2\n1\n0\n2\n0\n1\n2\n0\n1\n1\n4\n0\n4\n3\n\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, we need to choose the index $i = 2$ twice. After that, the array will be $a = [7, 5]$. The product of all the numbers in the array is $35$.\n\nIn the fourth test case, the product of the numbers in the array is $120$, which is already divisible by $5$, so no operations are needed.\n\nIn the eighth test case, we can perform two operations by choosing $i = 2$ and $i = 3$ in any order. After that, the array will be $a = [1, 6, 10]$. The product of the numbers in the array is $60$.\n\n### Format: Read the inputs from stdin solve the problem and write the answer to stdout (do not directly test on the sample inputs).

We consider an array good if it is a permutation of an array base[n].\nbase[n] = [1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n] (in other words, it is an array of length n + 1 which contains 1 to n - 1 exactly once, plus two occurrences of n). For example, base[1] = [1, 1] and base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3].\nReturn true if the given array is good, otherwise return false.\nNote: A permutation of integers represents an arrangement of these numbers.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2, 1, 3]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. However, base[3] has four elements but array nums has three. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3].

It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3] (by swapping the second and fourth elements in nums, we reach base[3]). Therefore, the answer is true.\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1, 1]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 1, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 1. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[1] = [1, 1]. Therefore, the answer is true.\nExample 4:\n\nInput: nums = [3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 4, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 4.

For example, \"aa\", \"aba\", \"adbgad\", and, \"abab\" are semi-palindrome and \"a\", \"ab\", and, \"abca\" are not.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abcac\", k = 2\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We can divide s into substrings \"ab\" and \"cac\". The string \"cac\" is already a semi-palindrome. If we change \"ab\" to \"aa\", it becomes a semi-palindrome with d = 1.\nIt can be shown that there is no way to divide the string \"abcac\" into two semi-palindrome substrings. Therefore, the answer would be at least 1.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abcdef\", k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can divide it into substrings \"abc\" and \"def\". Each of the substrings \"abc\" and \"def\" requires one change to become a semi-palindrome, so we need 2 changes in total to make all substrings semi-palindrome.\nIt can be shown that we cannot divide the given string into two substrings in a way that it would require less than 2 changes.\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"aabbaa\", k = 3\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: We can divide it into substrings \"aa\", \"bb\" and \"aa\".\nThe strings \"aa\" and \"bb\" are already semi-palindromes.

{"index": 146, "input": "**User**: \n### Question:\nYou are given an integer n and a 0-indexed integer array sick which is sorted in increasing order.\nThere are n children standing in a queue with positions 0 to n - 1 assigned to them. The array sick contains the positions of the children who are infected with an infectious disease. An infected child at position i can spread the disease to either of its immediate neighboring children at positions i - 1 and i + 1 if they exist and are currently not infected. At most one child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.\nIt can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get infected with the disease. An infection sequence is the sequential order of positions in which all of the non-infected children get infected with the disease. Return the total number of possible infection sequences.\nSince the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.\nNote that an infection sequence does not contain positions of children who were already infected with the disease in the beginning.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 5, sick = [0,4]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Children at positions 1, 2, and 3 are not infected in the beginning. There are 4 possible infection sequences:\n- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected since their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.\nNow, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 2 gets infected.\nFinally, the child at position 3 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 2 and 4 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,2,3].\n- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected because their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.\nNow, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 3 gets infected.\nFinally, the child at position 2 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 1 and 3 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,3,2].\n- The infection sequence is [3,1,2]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4].\n- The infection sequence is [3,2,1]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 4, sick = [1]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Children at positions 0, 2, and 3 are not infected in the beginning. There are 3 possible infection sequences:\n- The infection sequence is [0,2,3]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3].\n- The infection sequence is [2,0,3]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3].\n- The infection sequence is [2,3,0].

For example, if s == 11100, s[4] == 1 and s[2] == 0.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: k = 9, x = 1\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 can be written in binary representation as \"1\", \"10\", \"11\", \"100\", \"101\", and \"110\" respectively.\nSince x is equal to 1, the price of each number is the number of its set bits.\nThe number of set bits in these numbers is 9. So the sum of the prices of the first 6 numbers is 9.\nSo the answer is 6.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: k = 7, x = 2\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: Since x is equal to 2, we should just check even^th bits.\nThe second bit of binary representation of numbers 2 and 3 is a set bit. So the sum of their prices is 2.\nThe second bit of binary representation of numbers 6 and 7 is a set bit. So the sum of their prices is 2.\nThe fourth bit of binary representation of numbers 8 and 9 is a set bit but their second bit is not. So the sum of their prices is 2.\nNumbers 1, 4, and 5 don't have set bits in their even^th bits in their binary representation. So the sum of their prices is 0.\nThe second and the fourth bit of the binary representation of the number 10 are a set bit. So its price is 2.\nThe sum of the prices of the first 9 numbers is 6.\nBecause the sum of the prices of the first 10 numbers is 8, the answer is 9.\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= k <= 10^15\n1 <= x <= 8\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem.

Note that 5124 is not a powerful integer because the first digit is 5 which is greater than 4.\nIt can be shown that there are only 5 powerful integers in this range.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: start = 15, finish = 215, limit = 6, s = \"10\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The powerful integers in the range [15..215] are 110 and 210. All these integers have each digit <= 6, and \"10\" as a suffix.\nIt can be shown that there are only 2 powerful integers in this range.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: start = 1000, finish = 2000, limit = 4, s = \"3000\"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: All integers in the range [1000..2000] are smaller than 3000, hence \"3000\" cannot be a suffix of any integer in this range.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= start <= finish <= 10^15\n1 <= limit <= 9\n1 <= s.length <= floor(log_10(finish)) + 1\ns only consists of numeric digits which are at most limit.\ns does not have leading zeros.\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem.

The numbers 2, 4, and 8 have one set bit each with binary representation \"10\", \"100\", and \"1000\" respectively. The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits each with binary representation \"1111\" and \"11110\".\nWe can sort the array using 4 operations:\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,8,2,30,15].\n- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,2,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 4 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [2,4,8,30,15].\n- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. This operation is valid because 30 and 15 have four set bits each.

{"index": 176, "input": "**User**: \n### Question:\nYou are given two 1-indexed integer arrays, nums and, changeIndices, having lengths n and m, respectively.\nInitially, all indices in nums are unmarked. Your task is to mark all indices in nums.\nIn each second, s, in order from 1 to m (inclusive), you can perform one of the following operations:\n\nChoose an index i in the range [1, n] and decrement nums[i] by 1.\nIf nums[changeIndices[s]] is equal to 0, mark the index changeIndices[s].\nDo nothing.\n\nReturn an integer denoting the earliest second in the range [1, m] when all indices in nums can be marked by choosing operations optimally, or -1 if it is impossible.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,2,0], changeIndices = [2,2,2,2,3,2,2,1]\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: In this example, we have 8 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:\nSecond 1: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [1,2,0].\nSecond 2: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [0,2,0].\nSecond 3: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,1,0].\nSecond 4: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,0,0].\nSecond 5: Mark the index changeIndices[5], which is marking index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0.\nSecond 6: Mark the index changeIndices[6], which is marking index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.\nSecond 7: Do nothing.\nSecond 8: Mark the index changeIndices[8], which is marking index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.\nNow all indices have been marked.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 8th second.\nHence, the answer is 8.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3], changeIndices = [1,1,1,2,1,1,1]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: In this example, we have 7 seconds.

However, you must perform both operations at every second.\nReturn the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: word = \"abacaba\", k = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: At the 1st second, we remove characters \"aba\" from the prefix of word, and add characters \"bac\" to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to \"cababac\".\nAt the 2nd second, we remove characters \"cab\" from the prefix of word, and add \"aba\" to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to \"abacaba\" and reverts to its initial state.\nIt can be shown that 2 seconds is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: word = \"abacaba\", k = 4\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: At the 1st second, we remove characters \"abac\" from the prefix of word, and add characters \"caba\" to the end of word.

Let's recall the known solution: Actually the known solution for Leetcode 1775 uses a max-heap and bit counts, but the algorithm is: For each of k iterations, pop the largest number, find the largest bit that is set in any number and not set in the popped number, add that bit to the popped number, decrement bit count for that bit, push back. After k iterations, sum squares of all numbers in heap. That yields correct answer. But our simulation shows it fails for example. So maybe we mis-simulated bit counts. Let's recompute bit counts after first operation: We added bit3 to 2. That means we moved bit3 from 8 to 2. So bit3 count decreased from 1 to 0. But we also removed bit1 from 2? Wait 2 had bit1=1. After operation, 2 became 0, so bit1 count decreased by 1. So bit1 count goes from 2 to 1. So bit_counts: bit0:1, bit1:1, bit2:2, bit3:0. Good.\n\nNow we pop max: 10. Bits: bit3=1, bit1=1. Largest bit not set: bit2 count=2, 10 has bit2=0, add 4 => 14. bit_counts[2]-- =>1. So numbers: [0,6,5,14]. Sum squares: 14^2 + 6^2 = 196+36=232. So algorithm yields 232. But we can get 261. So algorithm fails. So maybe we mis-identified the largest bit not set: maybe we should consider bit0? bit0 count=1, 10 has bit0=0, add 1 => 11. That yields 121+36=157. So 232 is best. So algorithm fails.\n\nThus maybe the known solution is not to always add the largest bit not set in the popped number. Maybe we need to add the largest bit that is set in any number and not set in the popped number, but also we need to decrement bit count for that bit. That we did. So algorithm fails. So maybe we need to add the largest bit that is set in any number and not set in the popped number, but also we need to decrement bit count for that bit. That we did. So algorithm fails.

So maybe we need to add the largest bit that is set in any number and not set in the popped number, but also we need to decrement bit count for that bit. That we did. So algorithm fails. So maybe we need to stop.\n\nLet's check actual Leetcode editorial: I recall that the algorithm is indeed as described. So why does it fail? Let's test with actual code quickly mentally: Suppose we implement algorithm and test on example. Many people have solved this problem with that algorithm. So maybe we mis-simulated bit counts incorrectly. Let's recompute bit counts after first operation: We added bit3 to 2. But we also removed bit3 from 8. So bit3 count goes from 1 to 0. But we also removed bit1 from 2? Wait 2 had bit1=1. After operation, 2 became 0. So bit1 count goes from 2 to 1. So bit_counts: bit0:1, bit1:1, bit2:2, bit3:0. Good.\n\nNow we pop max: 10. Bits: bit3=1, bit1=1. Largest bit not set: bit2 count=2, 10 has bit2=0, add 4 => 14. bit_counts[2]-- =>1. So numbers: [0,6,5,14]. Sum squares: 14^2 + 6^2 = 196+36=232. So algorithm yields 232. But expected 261. So algorithm fails.\n\nThus maybe the known solution is wrong? But it's from Leetcode. Let's check the problem statement: \"You can do the following operation on the array any number of times: Choose any two distinct indices i and j and simultaneously update the values of nums[i] to (nums[i] AND nums[j]) and nums[j] to (nums[i] OR nums[j]).\" Wait, maybe we misinterpreted the operation: The new nums[j] uses the original nums[i] or the updated? It says simultaneously update, so we use original values. So we did that.\n\nBut maybe the known solution uses a different interpretation: They treat the operation as moving a bit from one number to another, but they also allow moving bits from the max number to others? But we only add bits to max. But maybe we can also move bits from max to others? But we don't need to.\n\nLet's search memory: I recall that the solution for Leetcode 1775 uses a max-heap and bit counts. But the algorithm is: For each of k iterations, pop the largest number, find the largest bit that is set in any number and not set in the popped number, add that bit to popped number, decrement bit count for that bit, push back.

So maybe we mis-simulated the bit counts after first operation: Actually after adding bit3 to 2, we removed bit3 from 8. But we also removed bit1 from 2? Wait 2 had bit1=1. After operation, 2 became 0. So bit1 count decreased by 1. So bit_counts: bit0:1, bit1:1, bit2:2, bit3:0. Good.\n\nNow we pop max: 10. Bits: bit3=1, bit1=1.

Let's check the official editorial: Actually I recall that the editorial says: \"We can think of the operation as moving a bit from one number to another. The sum of all numbers remains the same. The goal is to maximize the sum of squares of k numbers. The best strategy is to repeatedly take the largest number and add the largest bit that is not already present in it. This can be done by maintaining a max-heap and a bit count array.\" That is exactly what we did. So why does it fail?

Let's recompute bit counts after first operation: Actually after adding bit3 to 2, we removed bit3 from 8. So bit3 count goes from 1 to 0. But we also removed bit1 from 2? Wait 2 had bit1=1. After operation, 2 became 0. So bit1 count goes from 2 to 1. So bit_counts: bit0:1, bit1:1, bit2:2, bit3:0. Good.\n\nNow we pop max: 10. Bits: bit3=1, bit1=1.

Largest bit not set: bit2 count=2, 10 has bit2=0, add 4 => 14. bit_counts[2]-- =>1. So numbers: [0,6,5,14]. Sum squares: 14^2 + 6^2 = 196+36=232.
