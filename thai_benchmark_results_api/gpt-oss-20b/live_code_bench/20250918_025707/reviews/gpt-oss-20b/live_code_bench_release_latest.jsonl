He likes electronic music most of all, so he has created his own system of music notes, which, in his opinion, is best for it.\n\nSince Yarik also likes informatics, in his system notes are denoted by integers of $2^k$, where $k \\ge 1$ — a positive integer. But, as you know, you can't use just notes to write music, so Yarik uses combinations of two notes. The combination of two notes $(a, b)$, where $a = 2^k$ and $b = 2^l$, he denotes by the integer $a^b$.\n\nFor example, if $a = 8 = 2^3$, $b = 4 = 2^2$, then the combination $(a, b)$ is denoted by the integer $a^b = 8^4 = 4096$. Note that different combinations can have the same notation, e.g., the combination $(64, 2)$ is also denoted by the integer $4096 = 64^2$.\n\nYarik has already chosen $n$ notes that he wants to use in his new melody. However, since their integers can be very large, he has written them down as an array $a$ of length $n$, then the note $i$ is $b_i = 2^{a_i}$. The integers in array $a$ can be repeated.\n\nThe melody will consist of several combinations of two notes. Yarik was wondering how many pairs of notes $b_i, b_j$ $(i < j)$ exist such that the combination $(b_i, b_j)$ is equal to the combination $(b_j, b_i)$. In other words, he wants to count the number of pairs $(i, j)$ $(i < j)$ such that $b_i^{b_j} = b_j^{b_i}$.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimal number of adjacent\nswaps.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nMoving element `1` from index `i1` to index `0` requires exactly `i1`\nadjacent swaps, and it does not change the index of any element that\nwas originally to its right.\n\n**Proof.**  \nEach swap moves `1` one position left. After `i1` swaps it reaches\nindex `0`.  \nOnly elements left of `1` are swapped with it, so elements originally\nto the right keep their indices. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf `i1 > in`, after moving `1` to the front, the index of `n` becomes\n`in+1`.  \nIf `i1 < in`, the index of `n` stays `in`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWhen `i1 > in`, `1` passes over `n` during its leftward movement.\nEach time `1` swaps with `n`, `n` moves one step right, so after\ncrossing it ends at `in+1`.  \nIf `i1 < in`, `1` never touches `n`; its index is unchanged. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nAfter `1` is at the front, the minimal number of swaps needed to bring\n`n` to the back is\n\n```\n(n-1 - in)   if i1 < in\n(n-2 - in)   if i1 > in\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the current index of `n` is `in` (if `i1 < in`) or\n`in+1` (if `i1 > in`).  \nThe distance to the last position `n-1` is exactly the expressions\nabove, and each swap reduces that distance by one. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm’s answer equals the total number of swaps of the\nstrategy “move `1` to the front first, then `n` to the back”.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the first part costs `i1` swaps.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the second part costs the corresponding distance to\nthe back.  \nAdding them gives exactly the formula used by the algorithm. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nNo strategy can use fewer swaps than the algorithm.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider any sequence of swaps that produces a semi‑ordered\npermutation.\n\n* The element `1` must end at index `0`.  \n  To reach there it must be swapped leftwards at least `i1` times\n  (otherwise it would stay to the right of its original position).\n* The element `n` must end at index `n-1`.  \n  After all swaps, its final index is `n-1`.  \n  If `1` was moved before `n`, the situation of Lemma&nbsp;3 applies,\n  giving at least the same number of swaps for `n`.  \n  If `n` was moved before `1`, the same reasoning applies by symmetry.\n\nThus any valid sequence needs at least the number of swaps counted by\nthe algorithm. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`semiOrderedPermutation` returns the minimum possible number of\nadjacent swaps needed to transform `nums` into a semi‑ordered\npermutation.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm’s number of swaps is achievable.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;5 no smaller number is possible.  \nTherefore the algorithm is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

We can start by selecting the character 'a' at index 1. We then remove the closest 'a' to the left of index 1, which is at index 0, and the closest 'a' to the right of index 1, which is at index 2. After this operation, the string becomes \"abc\". Any further operation we perform on the string will leave it unchanged.

In the new string, we can select the character 'a' at index 2. The closest occurrence of an 'a' to its left is at index 1, and the closest occurrence of an 'a' to its right is at index 3.

distinct characters in s", "prediction": "**Solution Explanation**\n\nFor every character `c` in the string we look at the positions where `c` occurs.\nDuring one operation we pick an occurrence of `c` and delete the closest\noccurrence of `c` on its left and the closest one on its right\n(if they exist).  \nSo the operation removes **two adjacent occurrences of the same letter\nin the list of all occurrences of that letter**.\n\nAfter the deletion the remaining occurrences of `c` become adjacent\nagain, therefore we can repeat the same step until at most one\noccurrence of `c` is left.  \nThe only thing that can never be removed is a single occurrence of a\nletter – it has no neighbour of the same letter to delete.\n\nHence for every distinct letter we can always reduce its number of\noccurrences to exactly one.  \nNo operation can delete a letter that appears only once, so the final\nstring must contain at least one copy of every distinct letter.\nConversely, the strategy above shows that we can always achieve exactly\none copy of each distinct letter.\n\nTherefore the minimal possible length of the string equals the number\nof distinct characters in the original string.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Algorithm\n```\nminimizedStringLength(s):\n    return number of distinct characters in s\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimal possible length.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any letter `c` that appears at least twice in the current string,\nthere exists a sequence of operations that removes all but one\noccurrence of `c`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet the occurrences of `c` be `p1 < p2 < … < pk` (`k ≥ 2`).\n\n*If `k` is odd:*  \nChoose the middle occurrence `pm` (`m = (k+1)/2`).  \nDelete its left neighbour `p_{m-1}` and right neighbour `p_{m+1}`.\nThe remaining occurrences are `p1 … p_{m-2} , pm , p_{m+2} … pk`,\nwhich is a list of `k-2` occurrences.  \nRepeat the same step until only one occurrence remains.\n\n*If `k` is even:*  \nChoose the second occurrence `p2`.  \nDelete `p1` and `p3`.  \nThe remaining list has `k-2` occurrences and the first and last\noccurrences are now adjacent.  \nApply the odd‑case procedure to the remaining list (now of odd size)\nto delete all but one. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nNo operation can delete a letter that appears only once in the string.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nAn operation deletes the closest occurrence of the chosen character\nto the left and to the right of the chosen index.\nIf a character occurs only once, there is no other occurrence of the\nsame character on either side, so nothing can be deleted. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nAfter performing operations according to Lemma&nbsp;1 for every\nletter, the resulting string contains exactly one copy of each\ndistinct letter of the original string.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 we can reduce the number of occurrences of each letter\nto one.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 we cannot delete a letter that has become unique.\nThus after finishing the reductions for all letters, each distinct\nletter remains exactly once. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nAny string obtainable by the allowed operations contains at least one\ncopy of every distinct letter of the original string.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 a letter that appears only once can never be deleted.\nAll other letters can be deleted only in pairs, so at least one copy\nremains. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minimizedStringLength(s)` returns the minimal possible length of the\nstring after any number of allowed operations.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet `d` be the number of distinct letters in `s`.\n\n*Upper bound:*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 we can obtain a string of length `d`.  \nTherefore the minimal length is **at most** `d`.\n\n*Lower bound:*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 every obtainable string has length **at least** `d`.  \nTherefore the minimal length is **at least** `d`.\n\nSince both bounds equal `d`, the minimal possible length is exactly\n`d`, which is what the algorithm returns. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity Analysis\n\nLet `n = |s|` ( `n ≤ 100` ).\n\n* Building the set of distinct characters: `O(n)` time, `O(1)` extra\n  space (at most 26 letters).\n* Returning its size: `O(1)` time.\n\nTotal complexity: **O(n)** time, **O(1)** additional space.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimizedStringLength(self, s: str) ->

Observations\n\n* Decreasing a letter that is not `'a'` makes it *smaller*.\n* Decreasing an `'a'` turns it into `'z'`, which is *larger* than `'a'`.\n* The lexicographic order is decided by the first position where two strings differ.\n  Therefore we want the first changed character to be as small as possible.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.  Optimal strategy\n\n1. **Find the first character that is not `'a'`.**  \n   Changing any earlier `'a'` would only increase the string, so we must start\n   at the first non‑`'a'`.\n\n2. **Extend the substring while the characters are not `'a'`.**  \n   As long as we see a non‑`'a'`, decreasing it keeps the string smaller.\n   The moment we meet an `'a'`, decreasing it would create a `'z'` and would\n   *increase* the string at that position, so we stop before it.\n\n3. **Special case – all characters are `'a'`.**  \n   We still have to perform an operation.  \n   The best choice is to change the *last* character to `'z'`; all earlier\n   characters stay `'a'`, giving the smallest possible string.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the lexicographically smallest string.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nLet `i` be the first index with `s[i] != 'a'`.  \nAny optimal operation must start at or before `i`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*If the operation starts before `i`*  \nAll characters before `i` are `'a'`. Decreasing any of them would change an\n`'a'` to `'z'`, which is larger than `'a'`.  \nThus the resulting string would be larger at the first changed position,\ncontradicting optimality.\n\n*If the operation starts after `i`*  \nThen the character at position `i` remains unchanged, while we could start\nat `i` and decrease it, making the string smaller at the first differing\nposition. Hence starting after `i` cannot be optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nLet `i` be the first index with `s[i] != 'a'`.  \nIn an optimal operation the substring ends at the first index `j > i`\nwith `s[j] == 'a'` (or at the end of the string if no such `j` exists).\n\n**Proof.**\n\nAssume the optimal operation ends at some `k > i` with `s[k] != 'a'`\nand there exists a later index `j` (`i < j < k`) with `s[j] == 'a'`.  \nChanging the character at `j` from `'a'` to `'z'` would increase the string\nat position `j`, while all earlier positions are unchanged.  \nThus the string would be lexicographically larger, contradicting optimality.\nTherefore the operation cannot include any `'a'` after the start, so it must\nend just before the first such `'a'`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf the string consists only of `'a'`, the lexicographically smallest\nresult of one operation is obtained by changing the last character to `'z'`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nAny operation must change at least one character.  \nChanging any character other than the last would make the string larger at\nan earlier position than changing the last one, because all earlier positions\nwould stay `'a'`.  \nChanging the last character to `'z'` keeps all earlier positions minimal\n(`'a'`) and only changes the last position, which is the best possible\nchoice. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm `smallestString` returns the lexicographically smallest string\nobtainable by exactly one allowed operation.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*Case 1 – the string contains a non‑`'a'`.*  \nLet `i` be the first non‑`'a'`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 any optimal operation must start at or before `i`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 it must start exactly at `i` and end just before the first\n`'a'` after `i`.  \nThe algorithm chooses exactly this substring and decreases each character,\nwhich is the only way to obtain the smallest string in this case.\n\n*Case 2 – the string consists only of `'a'`.*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the optimal operation is to change the last character to `'z'`.  \nThe algorithm does exactly this.\n\nIn both cases the algorithm produces an optimal result. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.  Complexity Analysis\n\nLet `n = len(s)`.\n\n*Finding the first non‑`'a'` and the end of the block* – O(n) time.  \n*Building the result string* – O(n) time.  \nTotal time complexity: **O(n)**.  \nThe algorithm uses only a few indices and a new string of length `n`,\nso the space complexity is **O(n)** (the output itself).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Each `1`‑bit corresponds to one power of two, so `x` can be written\nwith exactly `popcount(x)` terms.\n\n*Lower bound:*  \nEach power of two contributes exactly one `1`‑bit to the binary sum of all terms.\nTherefore any representation of `x` with `t` terms must have at least `t` `1`‑bits,\nhence `t ≥ popcount(x)`.\n\nThus the minimal number equals `popcount(x)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed `k` there exists a sequence of `k` operations that turns `num1` into `0`\n**iff**\n\n```\nnum1 – k * num2  ≥  0   and   popcount( num1 – k * num2 )  ≤  k .\n```\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*If part:*  \nAssume the two conditions hold.  \nLet `x = num1 – k * num2`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1, `x` can be written as a sum of `t = popcount(x)` powers of two.\nBecause `t ≤ k`, we can add `k – t` extra terms equal to `1` (the smallest power of two).\nNow we have exactly `k` powers of two whose sum is `x`.  \nChoosing the corresponding indices `i` in the operations gives a sequence of `k`\noperations that subtracts `k * num2 + x = num1`, leaving `0`.\n\n*Only if part:*  \nSuppose a sequence of `k` operations exists.  \nLet the chosen powers of two be `p1, …, pk`.  \nTheir sum is `x = p1 + … + pk`.  \nThe total subtracted value is `k * num2 + x = num1`, so `x = num1 – k * num2`.  \nSince all `pi` are powers of two, `x` is non‑negative, giving the first inequality.\nThe representation uses exactly `k` terms, so by Lemma&nbsp;1\n`popcount(x) ≤ k`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf a solution exists, the minimal number of operations is at most 60.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet `k*` be the minimal feasible number of operations.\nFrom Lemma&nbsp;2 we have `popcount( num1 – k* * num2 ) ≤ k*`.  \nThe left side is at most 60, therefore `k* ≤ 60`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns\n\n* the minimal number of operations needed to make `num1` equal to `0`, or\n* `-1` if it is impossible.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*Soundness:*  \nThe algorithm checks all `k = 1 … 60`.  \nFor each `k` it verifies the two conditions of Lemma&nbsp;2.\nIf it returns a value `k0`, then by Lemma&nbsp;2 a sequence of `k0` operations exists,\nso the answer is feasible.\n\n*Optimality:*  \nAssume there exists a feasible solution with `k*` operations.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3, `k* ≤ 60`.  \nDuring the loop the algorithm examines `k = k*`.  \nSince `k*` satisfies the conditions, the algorithm will return a value\n`k0 ≤ k*`.  \nBut `k*` is minimal, hence `k0 = k*`.  \nThus the algorithm returns the minimal number.\n\n*Completeness:*  \nIf no `k` in `1 … 60` satisfies the conditions, then by Lemma&nbsp;3\nno feasible solution exists at all, so the correct answer is `-1`,\nwhich the algorithm returns. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible partition value.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor every index `i (0 ≤ i < n‑1)` the partition  \n`nums1 = s[0 … i]`, `nums2 = s[i+1 … n‑1]` has value `s[i+1] – s[i]`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`max(nums1) = s[i]` (largest element on the left).  \n`min(nums2) = s[i+1]` (smallest element on the right).  \nBoth sets are non‑empty because `i ≥ 0` and `i < n‑1`.  \nHence the value is `|s[i] – s[i+1]| = s[i+1] – s[i]`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nLet `d_min` be the minimum of all consecutive differences in the sorted\narray.  \nFor every valid partition the value is **at least** `d_min`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake an arbitrary partition and let `a = max(nums1)`, `b = min(nums2)`.  \nIn the sorted array let `k` be the index of `a` and `l` the index of\n`b`.  \nIf `k < l` then `b – a = s[l] – s[k]`.  \nBetween indices `k` and `l-1` there are consecutive pairs\n`(s[j], s[j+1])`.  \nThe smallest of their differences is ≤ `s[l] – s[k]`.  \nThus `b – a ≥ d_min`.  \nIf `k > l` the same argument applies after swapping the two sets\n(because the value is absolute).  \nTherefore every partition value is ≥ `d_min`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThere exists a partition whose value equals `d_min`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nLet `i` be an index where the consecutive difference `s[i+1] – s[i]`\nequals `d_min`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the partition that splits between `i` and `i+1` has value\nexactly `s[i+1] – s[i] = d_min`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the minimum possible value of a partition.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm computes `d_min`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 no partition can have a value smaller than `d_min`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 a partition with value `d_min` exists.  \nHence `d_min` is the minimum achievable value, and the algorithm\nreturns it. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.  Complexity Analysis\n\nSorting takes `O(n log n)` time.  \nThe single scan is `O(n)`.  \nTotal time: `O(n log n)`.\n\nThe algorithm uses `O(1)` additional space (apart from the input array\nand the space used by the sorting routine).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Dynamic Programming (DFS + memoisation)\n\nWe use a depth‑first search with memoisation (`lru_cache`) over the\nstate described above.\n\n```\ndfs(a, b, c, last)  →  maximum number of strings that can still be used\n```\n\n*Base case*  \nIf `a = b = c = 0` no block is left → return `0`.\n\n*Transition*  \nFor every block type that is still available\n\n```\nblock = \"AA\"   (needs a > 0)\nblock = \"BB\"   (needs b > 0)\nblock = \"AB\"   (needs c > 0)\n```\n\n```\nnew_string = last + block\nif len(new_string) >= 3 and new_string[-3:] in {\"AAA\", \"BBB\"}:\n        # forbidden, skip this block\nelse:\n        new_last = new_string[-2:]          # keep only the last two chars\n        best = max(best, 1 + dfs(a', b', c', new_last))\n```\n\n`a', b', c'` are the remaining counts after using the chosen block.\n\nThe recursion depth is at most the total number of blocks (≤ 150),\nwell below Python’s recursion limit after we raise it a little.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.  Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible length.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any state `(a,b,c,last)` the function `dfs(a,b,c,last)` returns\nthe maximum number of blocks that can still be appended to a string\nending with `last` while never creating `\"AAA\"` or `\"BBB\"`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nWe prove by induction over the number of remaining blocks `k = a+b+c`.\n\n*Base (`k = 0`).*  \nNo block is left, the only possible number of further blocks is `0`.\n`dfs` returns `0`.  The lemma holds.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the lemma holds for all states with fewer than `k` remaining\nblocks.  \nConsider a state with `k` remaining blocks.\n\n`dfs` examines every block type that is still available.\nFor each such block it checks whether appending it would create a\nforbidden substring.  \nIf it would, that block is discarded – any valid continuation must\navoid it, so discarding it cannot reduce the optimum.\n\nIf the block is allowed, `dfs` recursively calls itself on the\nstate that results after using that block.  \nBy the induction hypothesis the recursive call returns the maximum\nnumber of blocks that can be appended from that new state.\nAdding the current block gives a candidate total of  \n`1 + (maximum from the new state)`.\n\n`dfs` takes the maximum over all allowed blocks, therefore it returns\nthe maximum number of blocks that can be appended from the original\nstate. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nLet `S` be any valid concatenation of the given strings.\nLet `last` be the last two characters of `S` (or the empty string if\n`S` is empty).  \nThen the number of blocks used in `S` is **at most** `dfs(x,y,z,last)`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nWe prove by induction over the length of `S`.\n\n*Base (`|S| = 0`).*  \nNo block is used.  \n`dfs(x,y,z,\"\")` is at least `0` (the algorithm can always choose\nnothing).  The statement holds.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement holds for all valid strings shorter than `S`.  \nLet the first block of `S` be `B` (one of `\"AA\"`, `\"BB\"`, `\"AB\"`).\nRemoving `B` from the beginning of `S` yields a shorter valid string\n`S'`.  \nLet `last'` be the last two characters of `S'`.  \nThe remaining counts after removing `B` are exactly the arguments of\nthe recursive call that `dfs` would make when considering block `B`.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis the number of blocks in `S'` is at most\n`dfs(remaining_counts, last')`.  \nAdding the first block `B` gives\n\n```\nblocks(S) = 1 + blocks(S') ≤ 1 + dfs(remaining_counts, last')\n```\n\n`dfs(x,y,z,last)` takes the maximum over all allowed first blocks,\ntherefore it is at least the right hand side above, i.e.\n\n```\nblocks(S) ≤ dfs(x,y,z,last)\n```\n\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nLet `best` be the value returned by `dfs(x,y,z,\"\")`.  \nThere exists a valid concatenation that uses exactly `best` blocks.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n`dfs` constructs its value by exploring all possible first blocks\nand recursively the best continuation for each of them.\nWhenever a block is chosen, the algorithm guarantees that the\nconcatenation of the chosen block with the optimal continuation\ndoes not create a forbidden substring (this is checked before the\nrecursive call).  \nThus the sequence of choices that leads to the value `best` is a\nvalid concatenation using exactly `best` blocks. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`Solution.longestString(x, y, z)` returns the maximum possible length\nof a string that can be formed from the given blocks without\ncontaining `\"AAA\"` or `\"BBB\"`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet `best = dfs(x,y,z,\"\")`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 there exists a valid concatenation using exactly\n`best` blocks, so the maximum number of usable blocks is at least\n`best`.\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 every valid concatenation uses at most `best` blocks,\nso the maximum number of usable blocks is at most `best`.\n\nTherefore the maximum number of usable blocks equals `best`.  \nThe algorithm returns `2 * best`, which is exactly the maximum\npossible length. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Therefore `mainTank` strictly decreases and is bounded\nbelow by 0, so the loop ends exactly when the main tank is empty. ∎\n\n**Theorem**  \n`distance` returned by the algorithm equals the maximum distance the truck\ncan travel.\n\n*Proof.*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1, every iteration simulates one legal step of the truck’s\noperation. By Lemma&nbsp;2, the simulation stops only when the main tank\nis empty, at which point no further distance is possible.  \nThus the algorithm follows a valid sequence of operations and accumulates\nthe distance travelled in each step. No other sequence can yield a larger\ndistance because the truck’s behaviour is fully deterministic given the\ninitial fuel amounts. Therefore the returned `distance` is optimal. ∎\n\n---\n\n#### Complexity Analysis\n\nThe loop runs at most `mainTank / 4 + 1` times (each full cycle reduces the\nmain tank by at least 4 litres). With the given limits this is ≤ 26\niterations.  \nTime complexity: **O(1)** (constant for the constraints).  \nSpace complexity: **O(1)**.\n\n---\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def distanceTraveled(self, mainTank: int, additionalTank: int) -> int:\n        distance = 0\n        while mainTank > 0:\n            if mainTank >= 5:\n                # consume 5 litres\n                mainTank -= 5\n                distance += 5 * 10  # 50 km\n                if additionalTank > 0:\n                    # transfer 1 litre\n                    mainTank += 1\n                    additionalTank -= 1\n            else:\n                # consume the remaining fuel\n                distance += mainTank * 10\n                mainTank = 0\n        return distance\n```\n\nThis code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: 'return' outside function (<string>, line 52)\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 51, "group_id": 51, "sample_metadata": null}}

Return ans.\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the number of ways to split `nums` into good subarrays.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nIn any valid split, each subarray contains exactly one of the `k` ones and the subarrays are in the same order as the ones in `nums`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nA good subarray must contain a `1`.  \nIf a subarray contained two different ones, it would contain at least two `1`s, violating the definition.  \nThus each subarray contains exactly one `1`.  \nSince subarrays are contiguous and non‑overlapping, the order of the subarrays must follow the order of the ones in the original array. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor two consecutive ones at indices `ij` and `ij+1`, the split point between the subarray containing `ij` and the subarray containing `ij+1` can be placed after any index `p` with `ij ≤ p < ij+1`.  \nThere are exactly `ij+1 - ij` such positions.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe subarray containing `ij` must end at some index `p` that is **not** after `ij+1` (otherwise it would contain the second `1`).  \nThe earliest possible end is `ij` itself (the subarray `[…,1]`), the latest possible end is `ij+1-1`.  \nAll indices in this range are valid, giving `ij+1 - ij` possibilities. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe choices of split positions between different pairs of consecutive ones are independent.\n\n**Proof.**  \nA split position between `ij` and `ij+1` only determines where the subarray containing `ij` ends and the subarray containing `ij+1` starts.  \nIt does not affect the relative positions of any other pair of consecutive ones, because the subarrays are contiguous and non‑overlapping.  \nHence the decisions for different pairs do not influence each other. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the exact number of ways to split `nums` into good subarrays.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 any valid split corresponds to a choice of split positions between each consecutive pair of ones.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the number of choices for a particular pair is `ij+1 - ij`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the total number of splits is the product of these numbers over all pairs.  \nThe algorithm computes exactly this product (modulo `M`) and handles the edge cases (`0` ones → `0`, `1` one → `1`).  \nTherefore the algorithm’s output equals the required count. ∎\n\n\n\n---\n\n#### Complexity Analysis\n\nLet `n = len(nums)` and `k` be the number of ones.\n\n*Finding indices* takes `O(n)` time.  \n*Computing the product* iterates over `k-1` pairs, `O(k)` time.  \nOverall time complexity: `O(n)`.\n\nThe algorithm uses only a few integer variables and the list of indices, so the space complexity is `O(k)` (at most `O(n)` in the worst case).\n\n---\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfGoodSubarraySplits(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n        # collect indices of all ones\n        ones = [i for i, v in enumerate(nums) if v == 1]\n\n        # no ones -> impossible\n        if not ones:\n            return 0\n\n        # only one one -> only one subarray\n        if len(ones) == 1:\n            return 1\n\n        ans = 1\n        # multiply distances between consecutive ones\n        for prev, cur in zip(ones, ones[1:]):\n            ans = (ans * (cur - prev)) % MOD\n\n        return ans\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: invalid character '\\u2026' (U+2026) (<string>, line 38)\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 53, "group_id": 53, "sample_metadata": null}}

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns `True` iff the array can be made\nall zeros.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nDuring the scan, after processing index `i` the variable `cur`\nequals the total number of operations that affect index `i`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*Initially* `cur = 0` and no operation has started, so the lemma holds\nfor `i = 0`.\n\n*Induction step:*  \nAssume the lemma holds for index `i`.  \nWhen we move to `i+1` we first add `diff[i+1]` to `cur`.  \n`diff[i+1]` contains the negative of all operations that started at\n`i+1-k` and ended at `i`.  \nThus `cur` now equals the number of operations that started before\n`i+1` and are still active at `i+1`.  \nIf we start new operations at `i+1`, we add their count to `cur`\nand subtract the same count from `diff[i+1+k]`, so the invariant\nremains true for the next index. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf the algorithm starts `need` operations at index `i`, then after\nthese operations the value of `nums[i]` becomes zero.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBefore starting new operations the value of `nums[i]` after all\nprevious operations is `nums[i] - cur` (by Lemma&nbsp;1).  \nThe algorithm sets `need = nums[i] - cur` and starts exactly `need`\noperations at `i`.  \nEach operation decreases `nums[i]` by `1`, so the total decrease is\n`need`.  \nHence the new value is `nums[i] - cur - need = 0`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf the algorithm returns `False`, no sequence of operations can make\nthe array all zeros.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe algorithm returns `False` only when it needs to start an operation\nat some index `i` but `i + k > n`.  \nAny operation that starts at `i` would require a block of length `k`\nending at `i+k-1`, which lies outside the array.  \nTherefore no operation can reduce the value at index `i` any further,\nso the element at `i` will stay positive.  \nThus it is impossible to reach all zeros. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf the algorithm finishes the loop and returns `True`, the array can\nbe made all zeros.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBy construction, for every index `i` the algorithm starts exactly\n`need = nums[i] - cur` operations (if `need > 0`).  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2, after these operations the value at `i` becomes zero.\nAll operations started earlier are still counted in `cur`, so the\nvalues of the following indices are correctly updated.\nWhen the loop ends, every index has been processed and set to zero,\nhence the whole array is zero. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns `True` iff the array can be transformed into all\nzeros by repeatedly subtracting `1` from any subarray of length `k`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*If part:*  \nIf the algorithm returns `True`, by Lemma&nbsp;4 a sequence of\noperations exists that makes the array all zeros.\n\n*Only if part:*  \nAssume a sequence of operations exists.  \nDuring the greedy scan, whenever the algorithm needs to start an\noperation at index `i`, the existing sequence must also start at least\n`need` operations at `i` (otherwise the value at `i` would stay\npositive).  \nBecause the sequence is feasible, `i + k ≤ n`, so the algorithm never\nhits the impossible case of Lemma&nbsp;3.  \nThus the algorithm never returns `False` and finally returns `True`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

For each input string `w` it obtains `L` from Lemma 1 and, by Lemma 2, appends all non‑empty substrings of `L` to `result`.  \nSince the outer loop processes the strings in the order of `words`, and the inner loop preserves the order within each `L`, the concatenation of all appended substrings preserves the global order.  \nNo other strings are added, and no non‑empty substring is omitted.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the length of the longest valid\nsubstring.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor every occurrence of a forbidden word in `word`,\nthe algorithm records its interval `[start, end]` in `minEndStart[start]`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nDuring the scan, when the automaton reaches the node that represents\nthe last character of the forbidden word, that node’s output list contains\nthe length `L` of the word.  \nThe algorithm computes `start = pos - L + 1` and `end = pos`\nand updates `minEndStart[start]` with `end`.  \nThus the interval is recorded. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor every position `l`, `minEndFrom[l]` equals the minimal end\namong all forbidden intervals whose start is **≥ l**.\nIf no such interval exists, `minEndFrom[l] = ∞`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBy construction `minEndFrom[n] = ∞`.  \nAssume the statement holds for `i+1`.  \nFor position `i` we take the minimum of\n\n* `minEndStart[i]` – minimal end of intervals that start exactly at `i`\n  (or `∞` if none),\n* `minEndFrom[i+1]` – minimal end of intervals that start after `i`\n  (by induction hypothesis).\n\nTherefore `minEndFrom[i]` is the minimal end among all intervals that\nstart at or after `i`.  \nBy induction the lemma holds for all `i`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor any left border `l`, the longest substring starting at `l`\nthat contains **no** forbidden interval is of length\n\n```\nlen(l) =  (minEndFrom[l] - l)   if minEndFrom[l] != ∞\n          (n - l)               otherwise\n```\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*If `minEndFrom[l] = ∞`*:  \nNo forbidden interval starts at or after `l`, so any substring starting at\n`l` is valid. The longest one ends at the last character `n-1`,\nhence length `n-l`.\n\n*If `minEndFrom[l] = e`*:  \nThere exists a forbidden interval `[s, e]` with `s ≥ l` and `e` minimal.\nAny substring that ends at or after `e` would contain this whole interval,\nhence would be invalid.  \nThe substring `[l, e-1]` is valid (it does not contain `[s, e]` because\nits right end is `e-1 < e`), and any longer substring would be invalid.\nThus the maximal length is `e - l`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor every position `l`, the algorithm computes `len(l)` correctly.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe algorithm uses the value `minEndFrom[l]` obtained in Lemma&nbsp;2\nand applies exactly the formula of Lemma&nbsp;3. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the length of the longest valid substring of\n`word`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nFor each possible left border `l` the algorithm computes the maximum\nlength of a valid substring starting at `l` (Lemma&nbsp;4).\nThe overall maximum over all `l` is therefore the maximum length of\nany valid substring in the whole word.\nThus the returned value is exactly the desired answer. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Find the dominant element `D`\n\nThe array contains a majority element (`freq(D) > n/2`).  \nWe can find it in linear time with the Boyer–Moore majority vote algorithm:\n\n```\ncandidate = None\ncount = 0\nfor x in nums:\n    if count == 0:\n        candidate = x\n        count = 1\n    elif x == candidate:\n        count += 1\n    else:\n        count -= 1\n```\n\nAfter the loop `candidate` is the only possible dominant element.  \nBecause the problem guarantees that a dominant element exists, `candidate` is `D`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.  Prefix / suffix counts of `D`\n\nLet\n\n```\ntotalD = number of occurrences of D in the whole array\npref[i] = number of D in nums[0 … i]   (prefix inclusive)\n```\n\nWhile iterating over the array we can maintain `pref` on the fly and also\ncompute the suffix count as\n\n```\nsuff = totalD - pref\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.  Check every possible split\n\nFor each index `i` from `0` to `n-2`\n\n```\nleftLen  = i + 1\nrightLen = n - i - 1\n\nleftDominant  = pref * 2 > leftLen\nrightDominant = suff * 2 > rightLen\n```\n\nIf both are true, `i` is a valid split.  \nBecause we scan indices in increasing order, the first one we find is the\nminimum required index.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.  Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum valid split index or `-1`\nwhen none exists.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \n`D` is the only element that can be dominant in any subarray of `nums`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe whole array has exactly one dominant element `D`.  \nFor any subarray `S`, if an element `x ≠ D` were dominant in `S`,\nthen `freq_S(x) * 2 > |S|`.  \nBut `freq_S(x) ≤ freq(x) ≤ freq(D)` (because `D` is dominant in the whole array),\nhence `freq_S(x) * 2 ≤ freq(D) * 2 ≤ |nums|`.  \nSince `|S| ≤ |nums|`, this would contradict the dominance of `D` in the whole\narray. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed split index `i`, `D` is dominant in the left part iff  \n`pref[i] * 2 > i+1`.  \nSimilarly, `D` is dominant in the right part iff  \n`(totalD - pref[i]) * 2 > n-i-1`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe left part has length `i+1` and contains `pref[i]` copies of `D`.  \nBy the definition of dominance the inequality is exactly the condition.  \nThe right part contains the remaining copies of `D`, i.e. `totalD - pref[i]`,\nand its length is `n-i-1`. The same reasoning applies. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf the algorithm outputs an index `i`, then `i` is a valid split.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm outputs `i` only when both inequalities of Lemma&nbsp;2 hold.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1, only `D` can be dominant, so the inequalities guarantee that\n`D` is dominant in both parts.  \nThus the split at `i` satisfies the problem statement. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf a valid split exists, the algorithm outputs the smallest such index.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm scans indices in increasing order and stops at the first\nindex that satisfies the inequalities.  \nTherefore, if any valid split exists, the first one found is the minimum\nindex. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns\n\n* the minimum index of a valid split, if one exists;\n* `-1` otherwise.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If a valid split exists:*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm outputs the minimum index, and by Lemma&nbsp;3\nthis index is indeed valid.\n\n*If no valid split exists:*  \nThe algorithm never finds an index satisfying both inequalities, so it\nreturns `-1`.\n\nThus the theorem holds. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible number of\ngroups.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any integer `k`, if `Σ min(usageLimits[i], k) ≥ k(k+1)/2` then\n`k` groups of sizes `1,2,…,k` can be formed.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nSort the numbers by their remaining capacity (the value\n`min(usageLimits[i], k)`).  \nProcess the groups in increasing order of size.  \nWhen we start a group of size `t`, at least `t` numbers still have\npositive remaining capacity because the total remaining capacity is\nat least `k(k+1)/2` and we have already used at most\n`1+2+…+(t-1) = (t-1)t/2` slots.  \nChoose any `t` such numbers, decrease their remaining capacity by\n`1`, and continue.  \nBecause each number is used at most once per group, the process never\nfails. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf `Σ min(usageLimits[i], k) < k(k+1)/2` then it is impossible to\nform `k` groups of sizes `1,2,…,k`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe left side is the maximum number of slots that the numbers can\nfill (each number can contribute at most `min(usageLimits[i], k)` times).\nThe right side is the number of slots that must be filled.\nIf the maximum possible is smaller than the required number, no\nassignment can satisfy all groups. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every integer `k`, the feasibility test used by the algorithm\nreturns *true* exactly when `k` groups can be formed.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe test computes `C(k) = Σ min(usageLimits[i], k)` and compares it\nwith `S(k) = k(k+1)/2`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1, if `C(k) ≥ S(k)` the groups exist – the test returns\n*true*.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2, if `C(k) < S(k)` the groups do not exist – the test\nreturns *false*. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nLet `k*` be the maximum feasible number of groups.  \nThe binary search of the algorithm terminates with `low = k*`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe search interval always contains all feasible `k` values:\n\n* Initially `low = 0` is feasible, `high` is an upper bound that is\n  certainly feasible (because `high` satisfies `high(high+1)/2 ≤ total`,\n  and `total` is the sum of all capacities, so `C(high) ≥ total ≥\n  high(high+1)/2`).\n\n* In each iteration we test `mid`.  \n  *If* `mid` is feasible, all values `≤ mid` are feasible, so we set\n  `low = mid`.  \n  *If* `mid` is not feasible, all values `≥ mid` are not feasible, so\n  we set `high = mid-1`.\n\nThus the invariant “all feasible `k` lie in `[low, high]`” holds.\nWhen `low == high` the interval contains exactly one value, which\nmust be the largest feasible one, i.e. `k*`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`Solution.maxIncreasingGroups` returns the maximum possible number of\ngroups that satisfy all conditions.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm outputs `k*`, the largest feasible\nnumber of groups.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 feasibility is equivalent to the existence of a valid\nconstruction.  \nTherefore the returned value is exactly the maximum number of groups\nthat can be formed. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Sorting\n\nSort all offers by their finishing house (`end`).  \nAfter sorting, for every offer `i` all earlier offers finish **not later** than `i`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.  Dynamic programming\n\nLet\n\n```\ndp[i] = maximum gold we can earn using only the first i offers in the sorted list\n```\n\n`dp[0] = 0` – no offer, no gold.\n\nFor offer `i` (1‑based index in the sorted list) with data `(s, e, g)`:\n\n* **Skip it** – we keep the best value of the previous offers: `dp[i-1]`\n* **Take it** – we must add its gold to the best value of the last offer that ends before `s`.  \n  Let `j` be the largest index `< i` with `end_j < s`.  \n  Then the value is `dp[j] + g`.\n\nSo\n\n```\ndp[i] = max( dp[i-1] , dp[j] + g )\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.  Finding `j` – binary search\n\nAll `end` values are sorted.  \nFor a given `s` we need the number of offers whose `end` is `< s`.  \n`bisect_left(ends, s)` returns exactly that number – call it `pos`.  \nBecause `dp` is 1‑based, `dp[pos]` is the value we need.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.  Result\n\n`dp[m]` (where `m` is the number of offers) is the maximum gold obtainable.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.  Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible gold.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor every `i (1 ≤ i ≤ m)`, `dp[i]` equals the maximum gold obtainable using only the first `i` offers.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nInduction over `i`.\n\n*Base (`i = 1`):*  \nOnly offer 1 is available.  \n`dp[1] = max(dp[0], dp[0] + gold_1) = max(0, gold_1)` – correct.\n\n*Induction step:*  \nAssume the lemma holds for all indices `< i`.  \nConsider offer `i` with `(s, e, g)`.\n\n- **Case 1 – offer i is not chosen.**  \n  The best gold is the best achievable with the first `i-1` offers, which by induction hypothesis is `dp[i-1]`.\n\n- **Case 2 – offer i is chosen.**  \n  Any chosen set must contain only offers that finish before `s`.  \n  The last such offer has index `j` (the largest `< i` with `end_j < s`).  \n  By induction hypothesis the best gold from those offers is `dp[j]`.  \n  Adding `g` gives `dp[j] + g`.\n\nThe algorithm takes the maximum of the two cases, therefore `dp[i]` is optimal for the first `i` offers. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor every offer `i`, the binary search returns the correct index `j` of the last non‑overlapping offer.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n`ends` is sorted increasingly.  \n`bisect_left(ends, s)` returns the smallest index `pos` such that `ends[pos] ≥ s`.  \nAll indices `< pos` have `ends < s`, i.e. they finish before `s`.  \nThus `pos` is exactly the number of offers that finish before `s`.  \nBecause `dp` is 1‑based, the last such offer has index `pos`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`dp[m]` returned by the algorithm equals the maximum total gold that can be earned.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1, `dp[m]` is optimal for all `m` offers.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2, the transition used in the DP considers all feasible previous offers.  \nTherefore no better solution exists, and the algorithm achieves the optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.  Complexity Analysis\n\n*Sorting* – `O(m log m)`  \n*DP loop* – each iteration does a binary search `O(log m)` → `O(m log m)`  \nTotal time: `O(m log m)` where `m = len(offers)` (≤ 10⁵).  \n\nMemory: `O(m)` for the sorted offers, the `ends` array and the `dp` array.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.

Greedy idea\n\nWe keep the current multiset of powers of two in an array `cnt[0…30]`\n(`cnt[i]` – how many `2^i` we currently have).\n\nWe try to build the target from the largest power to the smallest:\n\n```\nremaining = target\nfor i from 30 down to 0:\n        use = min(cnt[i], remaining // 2^i)\n        remaining -= use * 2^i\n```\n\nIf after the loop `remaining == 0` we already have a suitable subsequence\nand no split is necessary.\n\nIf `remaining > 0` we are missing some amount of `2^i` for some `i`.\nThe only way to obtain more `2^i` is to split a larger power.\nThe cheapest way is to split the *smallest* larger power that is still\navailable – it gives us two `2^(i-1)` and costs one operation.\n\nWe repeat this process until the remaining amount becomes zero.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.  Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible number of\noperations.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nAfter each iteration of the outer loop (`i` from 30 down to 0) the\nmultiset `cnt` contains the *maximum* possible number of powers\n`2^j` for all `j > i` that can be obtained from the original array\nusing the already performed splits.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe algorithm never splits a power `2^j` with `j > i` after we have\nfinished the iteration for `i`.  \nAll splits that could increase the number of `2^j` for `j > i`\nmust be performed before we start processing `i`, otherwise we would\nmiss the chance to use them for larger powers.  \nTherefore, when we start the iteration for `i`, the multiset already\ncontains the maximum possible number of powers `2^j` for all `j > i`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nWhen the algorithm splits a power `2^k` (with `k > i`) to obtain more\n`2^i`, the number of operations performed is minimal among all\nstrategies that achieve the same multiset of powers up to level `i`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nSplitting a `2^k` gives exactly two `2^(k-1)`.  \nTo obtain one more `2^i` we must eventually split a `2^(i+1)` into two\n`2^i`.  \nAny strategy that produces an additional `2^i` must perform at least one\nsplit of a power larger than `i`.  \nThe algorithm always chooses the *smallest* such power that is still\navailable, which yields the required `2^i` with the fewest possible\nsplits. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nAfter finishing the loop for a fixed `i`, the remaining amount\n`remaining` is the smallest possible value that can still be achieved\nwith the current multiset of powers.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nDuring the iteration for `i` we use as many `2^i` as possible\n(`use = min(cnt[i], remaining // 2^i)`).\nIf we used fewer, the remaining amount would be larger.\nIf we used more, we would exceed the available count `cnt[i]`.\nThus the algorithm leaves the smallest possible remainder. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm outputs the minimum number of split operations needed to\nobtain a subsequence whose sum is `target`.  \nIf no such subsequence exists, it outputs `-1`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*Existence*  \nIf `target > sum(nums)` the algorithm immediately returns `-1`,\nwhich is correct because the total sum never increases.\n\nAssume `target ≤ sum(nums)`.  \nThe algorithm keeps splitting until `remaining` becomes zero.\nBecause the total sum is constant, after enough splits we can always\nobtain `target` (e.g. split everything into `1`s).  \nTherefore the algorithm will terminate with `remaining = 0`.\n\n*Optimality*  \nWe prove by induction on `i` (from 30 down to 0) that after finishing\nthe iteration for `i` the number of performed splits is minimal among\nall strategies that can achieve a subsequence summing to `target`.\n\nBase (`i = 30`):  \nNo split is needed for the largest power because we either use it\ndirectly or we will split a larger power (none exists).  \nThe algorithm does nothing, which is optimal.\n\nInduction step:  \nAssume the claim holds for all indices larger than `i`.  \nDuring the iteration for `i` the algorithm\n\n1. uses as many `2^i` as possible (Lemma&nbsp;3),\n2. splits the smallest available larger power whenever more `2^i` are\n   needed (Lemma&nbsp;2).\n\nBy the induction hypothesis the multiset of powers larger than `i`\nis already optimal.  \nThe only way to increase the number of `2^i` is to split a larger\npower, and the algorithm does it with the minimal possible cost.\nTherefore after finishing the iteration for `i` the total number of\nsplits is minimal.\n\nBy induction the algorithm is optimal for all `i`, in particular for\n`i = 0`.  \nWhen the loop ends, `remaining = 0`, so a subsequence with sum `target`\nexists and the number of performed splits is minimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.  Complexity Analysis\n\n*Counting powers* – `O(n)`  \n*Main loop* – at most 31 iterations, each may perform several splits.\nEach split reduces the total number of elements by one, so the total\nnumber of splits is bounded by `n * 30`.  \nTherefore the overall time complexity is `O(n + 30 * splits)`  \nwhich is `O(n)` for the given constraints (`n ≤ 1000`).\n\nThe array `cnt[0…30]` and a few integers are used –  \nspace complexity `O(1)`.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

idx) mod n`.  \nBy the rotation check, for all `i`  \n`nums[(idx + i) % n] = S[i]`.  \nRotating `nums` right by `k` positions moves the element at index `idx`\nto index `0`.  \nAfter this rotation the element at index `i` is\n`nums[(idx + i) % n] = S[i]`.  \nThus the resulting array equals `S`, which is sorted. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf `nums` can be sorted by right shifts, the algorithm returns a value\n(and not `-1`).\n\n**Proof.**\n\nAssume `nums` can be sorted by some number of right shifts.\nThen `nums` is a rotation of the sorted array `S`.  \nLet `idx` be the index of `S[0]` in `nums`.  \nBecause `nums` is a rotation of `S`, for all `i`  \n`nums[(idx + i) % n] = S[i]`.  \nHence the rotation check in the algorithm succeeds and it returns\n`(n - idx) mod n`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe value returned by the algorithm is the minimal number of right shifts\nneeded to sort `nums`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet the algorithm return `k`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1, `k` right shifts sort `nums`.  \nSuppose there exists a smaller number `k' < k` that also sorts `nums`.  \nThen `nums` would be a rotation of `S` by `k'` right shifts, i.e. a rotation\nby `n - k'` left shifts.  \nBut the index of `S[0]` in `nums` would then be `n - k'`, which is\nstrictly larger than `n - k`.  \nThus the algorithm would have found a larger `idx` and returned a smaller\n`k`, contradicting that it returned `k`.  \nTherefore no smaller number of shifts can sort the array. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns\n\n* the minimal number of right shifts that sorts `nums`, or\n* `-1` if no sequence of right shifts can sort `nums`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nIf the algorithm returns a number, by Lemma&nbsp;1 it sorts the array,\nand by Lemma&nbsp;3 it is minimal.  \nIf the algorithm returns `-1`, the rotation check failed, so by\ncontrapositive of Lemma&nbsp;2 the array cannot be sorted by any\nright shifts. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity Analysis\n\n*Sorting* takes `O(n log n)` time.  \nAll other operations are linear, `O(n)`.  \nSpace usage is `O(n)` for the sorted copy.\n\nWith `n ≤ 100` this easily satisfies the constraints.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumRightShifts(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n\n        sorted_nums = sorted(nums)\n        # index of the smallest element in the original array\n        idx = nums.index(sorted_nums[0])\n\n        # verify that nums is a rotation of sorted_nums\n        for i in range(n):\n            if nums[(idx + i) % n] != sorted_nums[i]:\n                return -1\n\n        # minimal right shifts needed\n        return (n -

students are happy. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed `k` satisfying condition 1 of Lemma&nbsp;1, there exists **at most one**\nhappy group, namely the set of all indices with `nums[i] < k`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the membership of each student is forced:  \nindices with `nums[i] < k` must be selected, indices with `nums[i] > k` must not be\nselected.  \nNo other indices exist because `k` is not equal to any `nums[i]`.  \nHence the group is uniquely determined. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a fixed `k` (not present in `nums`) the unique group described in Lemma&nbsp;2\nis happy **iff** `count(nums[i] < k) = k`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe unique group contains exactly the indices with `nums[i] < k`.  \nIts size is `count(nums[i] < k)`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the group is happy exactly when its size equals `k`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm outputs the number of ways to select a group of students so that\nevery student is happy.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe algorithm iterates over all integers `k` from `0` to `n`.\n\n* If `k` is present in `nums`, the algorithm skips it.  \n  By Lemma&nbsp;1 no happy group can exist for such a `k`.\n\n* If `k` is not present in `nums`, the algorithm computes  \n  `idx = count(nums[i] < k)` via binary search.  \n  It increments the answer exactly when `idx == k`.  \n  By Lemma&nbsp;3 this condition is equivalent to the existence of a happy group\n  for that `k`.  \n  By Lemma&nbsp;2 there is at most one such group, so the increment counts it\n  exactly once.\n\nThus each happy group is counted once, and no non‑happy configuration is counted.\nTherefore the final answer equals the required number of ways. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity

Actually `y > x`, so `P[0] + y` is larger.\n  But we will show that the overall maximum does not increase.\n\n* For `P[j]` the new maximum is `x` (since `x < y`), so its finish time\n  becomes `P[j] + x`.  \n  Because `P[j]` starts later,  \n  `P[j] + x ≤ P[j] + y`.\n\nThus the maximum finish time over all processors does not increase\nafter the swap.  \nRepeating this argument for all processors yields the greedy assignment,\nhence an optimal solution must have the largest task with the earliest\nprocessor. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nAfter assigning the first four tasks of `T` to `P[0]`, the remaining\nproblem (assigning the rest of the tasks to the remaining processors)\nis identical in structure to the original problem.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe four tasks given to `P[0]` are fixed; the maximum of them is\n`T[0]`.  \nAll other tasks are still unassigned and the remaining processors are\nexactly the same as before, only with one fewer processor.\nThus the sub‑problem is the same type: `n-1` processors, `4(n-1)` tasks. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe algorithm produces an optimal assignment for the sub‑problem after\nthe first processor is fixed.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the greedy choice for the first processor is optimal.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the remaining sub‑problem has the same structure,\nso applying the same greedy rule recursively yields an optimal\nassignment for the whole problem. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minProcessingTime` returns the minimum possible time when all tasks\nhave been executed.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe algorithm assigns processors in ascending order of start time,\neach time giving them the next four largest remaining tasks.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 this greedy choice is optimal for the first processor\nand, recursively, for all subsequent processors.\nTherefore the finish time computed by the algorithm is the minimum\npossible maximum finish time over all processors. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible number of\noperations or `-1` if impossible.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed pair `(target1,target2)` the algorithm computes the\nminimum number of swaps needed to satisfy the conditions at indices\n`0 … n-2`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nFor each index `i < n-1` the algorithm examines the two possible\nchoices (keep / swap).\n\n*If both choices satisfy the inequalities*  \nChoosing keep gives cost `0`, swapping gives cost `1`.  \nSince we want the minimum, keep is optimal.\n\n*If only one choice satisfies*  \nThe other choice is infeasible, so the only feasible choice must be\ntaken, giving the unique minimal cost for that index.\n\n*If none satisfies*  \nNo feasible assignment exists for this index, therefore no assignment\nfor the whole array exists with the given `(target1,target2)`.\n\nBecause the indices are independent, summing the minimal costs for\nall indices yields the global minimum for this pair. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf there exists any sequence of swaps that satisfies the two\nconditions, then at least one of the two examined pairs\n`(nums1[n-1], nums2[n-1])` or `(nums2[n-1], nums1[n-1])`\nis feasible.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nIn any feasible final array the value at position `n-1` of\n`nums1` is either the original `nums1[n-1]` (no swap at that index)\nor the original `nums2[n-1]` (swap at that index).  \nSimilarly for `nums2`.  \nThus the final pair of values at `n-1` must be exactly one of the two\npairs considered by the algorithm. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor each of the two examined pairs the algorithm returns the minimum\nnumber of swaps among all sequences that end with that pair.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nDirectly from Lemma&nbsp;1: for a fixed pair the algorithm finds the\nminimum cost for indices `0 … n-2`.  \nAdding the optional swap at `n-1` (cost `0` or `1`) gives the minimum\ncost for all sequences that end with that pair. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns\n\n* the minimum possible number of operations that satisfy both\n  conditions, or\n* `-1` if no such sequence of operations exists.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*If a feasible sequence exists:*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 at least one of the two pairs is feasible.  \nFor each feasible pair, by Lemma&nbsp;3 the algorithm computes the\nminimum cost among all sequences ending with that pair.  \nTaking the minimum over the two pairs therefore yields the global\nminimum.\n\n*If no feasible sequence exists:*  \nBoth pairs are infeasible, so the algorithm reports `-1`.\n\nThus the algorithm is correct. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible frequency.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any set of indices `S` the minimal number of operations needed to make\nall elements equal is achieved by setting the target value to the median of\n`{nums[i] | i ∈ S}`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nFor a fixed target `v` the cost is `Σ |nums[i] – v|`.  \nThe function `f(v) = Σ |nums[i] – v|` is convex and its minimum is attained\nat any median of the multiset `{nums[i]}`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nLet `S` be an optimal set of indices (maximal size with cost ≤ `k`).\nAfter sorting the array, the indices of `S` form a contiguous segment.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nAssume the contrary: there exist indices `i < j < k` with  \n`i, k ∈ S` but `j ∉ S`.  \nBecause the array is sorted, `nums[i] ≤ nums[j] ≤ nums[k]`.  \nReplacing `nums[j]` by either `nums[i]` or `nums[k]` can only reduce the\ntotal absolute deviation of the set (by the triangle inequality), thus\nthe cost would not increase.  \nTherefore we could replace `j` by `i` or `k` and obtain a set of the same\nsize with a cost no larger than before – contradicting the optimality of\n`S`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every window `[l … r]` the algorithm computes the minimal cost to\nmake all its elements equal.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the minimal cost is obtained by setting the target to the\nmedian `a[m]`.  \nThe formulas for `left` and `right` are exactly the sums of\n`a[m] – a[i]` for the left part and `a[i] – a[m]` for the right part,\nwhich are the absolute differences to the median.  \nThus `total` equals the minimal possible cost for this window. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nDuring the scan the algorithm keeps the invariant  \n`total ≤ k` for the current window `[l … r]`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nWhen `r` is increased, the new window may violate the invariant.\nThe algorithm then repeatedly increments `l` until the invariant holds\nagain.  \nBecause `l` only moves forward, the invariant is preserved for all\nsubsequent steps. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nFor every feasible window (cost ≤ `k`) the algorithm will consider it\nand update the answer with its length.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nTake any feasible window `[l₀ … r₀]`.  \nDuring the scan, when `r` reaches `r₀`, the algorithm will have a left\npointer `l` that is **not larger** than `l₀` (since `l` only moves\nrightwards).  \nIf `l < l₀`, the window `[l … r₀]` is larger and still feasible\n(because removing elements from the left can only reduce the cost).\nThus the algorithm will shrink `l` until it equals `l₀` or the window\nbecomes infeasible.  \nIn the former case the window `[l₀ … r₀]` is examined and its length\nupdates the answer. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`maxFrequencyScore` returns the maximum possible frequency that can be\nachieved with at most `k` operations.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet `ans` be the value returned by the algorithm.\n\n*Upper bound:*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 every window considered by the algorithm has cost ≤ `k`,\nhence its length is a feasible frequency.  \nTherefore `ans` is at most the optimum.\n\n*Lower bound:*  \nLet `S*` be an optimal set of indices.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 its indices form a contiguous segment `[l* … r*]`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the algorithm computes the minimal cost for this window,\nwhich is ≤ `k`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;5 the algorithm will examine this window and set\n`ans ≥ |S*|`.  \nThus `ans` is at least the optimum.\n\nCombining both bounds, `ans` equals the optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the number of good strings.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nA string of length `n` is good **iff** it contains at least one `'l'`,\nat least two `'e'`, and at least one `'t'`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*If* the string contains those letters, we can reorder it so that the\nfour letters `l e e t` appear consecutively – that is the substring\n`\"leet\"`.  \n*Only if* the string is good, after some reordering it contains the\nsubstring `\"leet\"`.  \nThe substring uses exactly one `'l'`, two `'e'` and one `'t'`, so the\noriginal string must contain at least those numbers of each letter. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor any `n ≥ 0` the cardinalities listed in the table above are correct.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nAll counts are standard combinatorial arguments:\n\n* `E_l` – every position can be any of the 25 letters except `'l'` → `25^n`.\n* `E_t` – symmetric to `E_l`.\n* `F_e` –  \n  *no 'e'*: `25^n`.  \n  *exactly one 'e'*: choose its position in `n` ways, fill the rest with\n  any of the 25 other letters → `n·25^{n-1}`.\n* `E_l∩E_t` – exclude two letters → `24^n`.\n* `E_l∩F_e` – alphabet size 25 (no `'l'`).  \n  *no 'e'*: `24^n`.  \n  *exactly one 'e'*: `n·24^{n-1}`.\n* `E_t∩F_e` – symmetric to `E_l∩F_e`.\n* `E_l∩E_t∩F_e` – alphabet size 24 (no `'l'` and no `'t'`).  \n  *no 'e'*: `23^n`.  \n  *exactly one 'e'*: `n·23^{n-1}`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \n`|E_l ∪ E_t ∪ F_e|` computed by the inclusion–exclusion formula equals\nthe number of strings that are **not** good.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBy definition, a string is not good iff it violates at least one of the\nthree conditions of Lemma&nbsp;1, i.e. it belongs to at least one of the\nsets `E_l`, `E_t`, `F_e`.  \nThus the set of non‑good strings is exactly the union\n`E_l ∪ E_t ∪ F_e`.  \nInclusion–exclusion gives the exact size of a finite union, so the\nformula yields the correct cardinality. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \n`answer = 26^n – |E_l ∪ E_t ∪ F_e|` equals the number of good strings.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nAll length‑`n` strings over 26 letters form a universe of size `26^n`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3, the complement of the union is precisely the set of good\nstrings.  \nSubtracting the size of the complement from the universe size gives the\nsize of the complement itself. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`stringCount(n)` returned by the algorithm equals the number of good\nstrings of length `n` (modulo `1 000 000 007`).\n\n**Proof.**\n\n* If `n < 4`, no string can contain the 4‑letter substring `\"leet\"`,\n  so the algorithm returns `0`, which is correct.\n\n* For `n ≥ 4`, the algorithm computes all powers and products needed\n  for the inclusion–exclusion formula, applies the formula, and finally\n  subtracts from `26^n`.  \n  By Lemma&nbsp;4 this value is exactly the number of good strings.\n  All operations are performed modulo `M`, so the returned value is the\n  required answer modulo `M`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns `true` exactly for the queries\nfor which the string can be turned into a palindrome.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nIf the total number of any character in the left half differs from the\ntotal number of that character in the right half, no query can succeed.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nRearranging inside the two allowed ranges does not change the multiset of\ncharacters in each half.  \nA palindrome requires the two halves to contain the same multiset of\ncharacters.  ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed query, if there exists a pair `(i , n-1-i)` with\n`i ∉ [a,b]` and `n-1-i ∉ [c,d]` such that `s[i] ≠ s[n-1-i]`,\nthen the query cannot succeed.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBoth positions of the pair are outside the allowed ranges, therefore\ntheir characters cannot be changed.  \nIn a palindrome the two characters of every pair must be equal, so the\nquery is impossible. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nLet `outside_left[x]` and `outside_right[x]` be defined as above.\nIf for some character `x`\n\n```\noutside_left[x]  >  R[x]   or   outside_right[x] > L[x]\n```\n\nthen the query cannot succeed.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n`outside_left[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in the left half\nthat are outside the allowed range `[a,b]`.  \nEach of them must be matched with a `x` from the right half inside\n`[c,d]`.  \nIf `R[x]` is smaller, there are not enough `x` in the right inside\nrange to supply all required matches – impossible.  \nThe argument for the other inequality is symmetric. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf for every character `x`\n\n```\ntotal_left[x] ≤ L[x] + R[x]\n```\n\nthen the inequalities of Lemma&nbsp;3 hold.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n`outside_left[x] = total_left[x] – L[x]`.  \nThe inequality of the lemma gives\n\n```\ntotal_left[x] – L[x]  ≤  R[x]\n```\n\nwhich is exactly `outside_left[x] ≤ R[x]`.  \nThe same reasoning with the right half gives\n`outside_right[x] ≤ L[x]`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nAssume the conditions of Lemma&nbsp;2 and Lemma&nbsp;4 hold.\nThen the remaining characters inside the two ranges can be paired\narbitrarily, i.e. the multiset of the remaining left characters equals\nthe multiset of the remaining right characters.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet `rem_left[x] = L[x] – outside_left[x]` and\n`rem_right[x] = R[x] – outside_right[x]`.  \nUsing the definitions of `outside_left/right` and the equality of the\ntotal counts of each character in the whole halves we obtain\n\n```\nrem_left[x] = total_left[x] – outside_left[x] – L[x]\n            = total_left[x] – (total_left[x] – L[x]) – L[x]\n            = 0\n```\n\nand similarly `rem_right[x] = 0`.  \nThus the multisets of the remaining characters are identical (both\nempty), so they can be paired arbitrarily. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 6  \nIf the algorithm outputs `true` for a query, then the string can be\nmade a palindrome.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe algorithm checks\n\n1. the fixed‑pair condition (Lemma&nbsp;2),\n2. the inequality `total_left[x] ≤ L[x] + R[x]` for all `x`\n   (Lemma&nbsp;4).\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;5 the remaining characters inside the two ranges can be\npaired arbitrarily.  \nTherefore we can rearrange the two ranges so that every pair of\nmirrored positions contains the same character – the whole string is a\npalindrome. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 7  \nIf the string can be made a palindrome for a query, the algorithm\noutputs `true`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nIf a palindrome is possible, all fixed pairs must match – otherwise the\npalindrome would already be impossible.  \nThus the algorithm’s fixed‑pair test succeeds.\n\nLet the palindrome be obtained by some rearrangement of the two ranges.\nAll characters that are outside both ranges are already matched with\neach other, so the inequalities of Lemma&nbsp;3 hold.\nConsequently the inequalities of Lemma&nbsp;4 also hold.\nHence the algorithm’s second test succeeds and it outputs `true`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nFor every query the algorithm returns `true` **iff** the string can be\nmade a palindrome by rearranging the two specified substrings.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*If* part – Lemma&nbsp;6.  \n*Only if* part – Lemma&nbsp;7. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the number of good partitions.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any index `i` (0 ≤ i < n-1), a cut after `i` is allowed  \niff `maxLast == i` at that moment.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*If part:*  \nAssume `maxLast == i`.  \nFor every value `x` that appears in the left part, its last occurrence is\n`last[x] ≤ maxLast = i`.  \nThus `x` does not appear in the right part, so the cut is valid.\n\n*Only if part:*  \nAssume a cut after `i` is valid.  \nThen no value in the left part appears in the right part, so for every\nvalue `x` in the left part `last[x] ≤ i`.  \nTherefore `maxLast = max(last[x]) ≤ i`.  \nBut `maxLast` is at least `i` because `nums[i]` itself appears at `i`.  \nHence `maxLast = i`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nLet `C` be the set of indices `i` (0 ≤ i < n-1) with `maxLast == i`.  \nAny subset of `C` yields a good partition.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nTake any subset `S ⊆ C` and cut after every `i ∈ S`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 each cut is valid.  \nCuts are independent: after a cut at `i` the left part contains only values\nwhose last occurrence is ≤ i, so none of them appears in the remaining suffix.\nThus no value can appear in two different sub‑arrays.  \nTherefore the resulting partition is good. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nEvery good partition corresponds to a unique subset of `C`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nConsider a good partition.  \nLet `S` be the set of indices after which the partition cuts.\nBecause the partition is good, each cut is valid, so by Lemma&nbsp;1\n`maxLast == i` for every `i ∈ S`.  \nThus `S ⊆ C`.  \nConversely, any subset of `C` produces a good partition by Lemma&nbsp;2,\nso the mapping is bijective. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the exact number of good partitions of `nums`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet `k = |C|`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the number of good partitions equals the number of subsets of `C`,\nwhich is `2^k`.  \nThe algorithm counts `k` and outputs `pow(2, k, MOD)`, hence it returns the\ncorrect value modulo `10^9+7`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.  Complexity Analysis\n\n*Building `lastPos`* – O(n) time, O(n) memory.  \n*Scanning the array* – O(n) time, O(1) extra memory.  \n\nTotal: **O(n)** time, **O(n)** memory (dominated by the dictionary).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Observations\n\n* The children that are already sick split the queue into several\n  *gaps*.\n  * `gap 0` – children before the first sick child  \n  * `gap k+1` – children after the last sick child  \n  * `gap i` ( `1 ≤ i ≤ k` ) – children between two consecutive sick\n    children\n\n  For a gap of length `L`\n\n  * **end gaps** (`gap 0` or `gap k+1`)  \n    Only one side is infected, therefore the children inside the gap\n    must be infected in the only possible order – from the infected side\n    towards the other end.  \n    Number of ways inside such a gap = `1`.\n\n  * **internal gaps** (`1 ≤ i ≤ k`)  \n    Both ends are infected.  \n    At any moment the only infectable children are the two ends of the\n    still uninfected part of the gap.  \n    So we can remove the leftmost or the rightmost child – exactly the\n    same as removing a character from the left or the right of a string.\n    For a gap of length `L` the number of possible orders is\n\n    ```\n    2^(L-1)\n    ```\n\n    (first child can be chosen in 2 ways, the next one again in 2 ways,\n    …, until only one child is left).\n\n* The gaps are independent – the only restriction between different\n  gaps is that the overall order of all infected children must be a\n  permutation of all children that are not sick.\n  Therefore we have to interleave the orders of the individual gaps.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.  Counting the interleavings\n\nLet\n\n```\nm          = total number of children that are not sick\nL1, L2, …  = lengths of all gaps (including the two end gaps)\n```\n\nThe number of ways to interleave the children of all gaps is the\nmultinomial coefficient\n\n```\nm! / (L1! · L2! · …)\n```\n\nBecause we work modulo a prime, we pre‑compute factorials and inverse\nfactorials and evaluate the multinomial coefficient as\n\n```\nfact[m] · invFact[L1] · invFact[L2] · …\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.  Final formula\n\n```\nanswer = ( product over all gaps of ways_inside_gap )\n          · ( m! / product of gap factorials )\n```\n\n* For an end gap: `ways_inside_gap = 1`\n* For an internal gap of length L: `ways_inside_gap = 2^(L-1)`\n\nAll operations are performed modulo `MOD`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.  Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the number of all possible infection\nsequences.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor an end gap of length `L` there is exactly one possible infection\nsequence inside this gap.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nOnly the child adjacent to the already infected child can be infected\nfirst. After that child becomes infected, the next child adjacent to it\nbecomes infectable, and so on.  \nThus the infection must proceed strictly from the infected side towards\nthe other end – a unique order. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor an internal gap of length `L` the number of possible infection\nsequences inside this gap equals `2^(L-1)`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nInitially the two children next to the infected children on both sides\nare infectable.  \nAfter infecting one of them, the new infectable children are again the\ntwo ends of the remaining uninfected part of the gap.  \nThus at every step we have exactly two choices (left or right) until\nonly one child remains, which is forced.  \nThe number of different sequences is therefore the number of binary\nchoices made in the first `L-1` steps, i.e. `2^(L-1)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nLet `S` be the set of all children that are not sick initially.\nFor any fixed order of the children inside each gap, the number of\nglobal infection sequences that respect this order equals the\nmultinomial coefficient\n\n```\n|S|! / (L1! · L2! · …)\n```\n\n**Proof.**\n\nInside each gap the relative order of its children is fixed.\nThe global infection sequence is a permutation of all children in `S`\nthat preserves these relative orders.\nThe number of such permutations is exactly the number of ways to\ninterleave the `k+2` sequences of lengths `L1, L2, …` – the standard\nmultinomial coefficient. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm counts every valid infection sequence exactly once.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n* By Lemma&nbsp;1 and Lemma&nbsp;2 the algorithm multiplies the correct\n  number of possibilities for each individual gap.\n* By Lemma&nbsp;3 the multinomial factor counts all possible\n  interleavings of these gap‑orders.\n* The product of the two factors therefore counts every global\n  infection sequence exactly once. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`Solution.numberOfSequence` returns the total number of possible\ninfection sequences modulo `10^9+7`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe algorithm computes\n\n```\nproduct_over_gaps(ways_inside_gap) · multinomial_coefficient\n```\n\nwhich, by Lemma&nbsp;4, equals the number of all valid infection\nsequences.  \nAll arithmetic is performed modulo `MOD`, so the returned value is the\nrequired answer modulo `10^9+7`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible total cost.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any array `nums`, the function  \n`cost(y) = Σ |nums[i] – y|` is convex and attains its minimum on\nevery median of the sorted array (odd `n`) or on every value inside the\ninterval `[nums[n/2-1] , nums[n/2]]` (even `n`).\n\n**Proof.**\n\n`cost(y)` is a sum of absolute value functions, each of which is convex.\nThe sum of convex functions is convex.  \nFor a convex, piece‑wise linear function the minimum is reached at a\npoint where the left derivative is ≤ 0 and the right derivative is ≥ 0.\nFor odd `n` this happens exactly at the middle element (the median).\nFor even `n` the derivative changes sign inside the interval between the\ntwo middle elements, therefore every point of that interval is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nLet `x` be any integer.  \n`nearest≤x` (resp. `nearest≥x`) returned by the helper functions is the\nlargest (resp. smallest) palindromic integer `≤ x` (resp. `≥ x`).\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe helper first constructs the palindrome obtained by mirroring the\nfirst half of `x`.  \nIf it already satisfies the inequality, it is obviously the closest\npalindrome on that side.\n\nOtherwise the helper changes the first half by exactly one (decrement or\nincrement).  \nChanging the first half by one changes the whole palindrome by the\nsmallest possible amount that keeps the same number of digits.\nIf the change shortens the first half, the helper returns the largest\npalindrome with one digit less – which is the next smaller palindrome.\nIf the change lengthens the first half, the helper returns the smallest\npalindrome with one digit more – which is the next larger palindrome.\n\nThus the helper always returns the nearest palindrome on the requested\nside. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor odd `n` the optimal target value `y*` is either `nearest≤median`\nor `nearest≥median`.  \nFor even `n` the optimal `y*` is either `nearest≤a`, `nearest≥b`,\nor a palindrome inside `[a,b]`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the minimum of `cost(y)` is achieved at a median\n(odd) or inside the median interval (even).  \nIf the median (or any point of the interval) is already a palindrome,\nit is obviously optimal.  \nOtherwise the minimum must be reached at the closest palindrome on the\nside of the median (or the interval).  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 these are exactly the candidates listed above. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm evaluates `cost(y)` for every candidate listed in\nLemma&nbsp;3.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe algorithm explicitly constructs all candidates described in\nLemma&nbsp;3 and stores them in a set (duplicates are removed).  \nIt then iterates over this set and computes the cost for each element.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minimumCost` returns the minimum possible total cost to make the array\nequalindromic.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet `y*` be an optimal target value.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3, `y*` is one of the candidates considered by the\nalgorithm.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm evaluates `cost(y*)`.  \nThe algorithm returns the minimum over all evaluated costs, therefore\nthe returned value is at most `cost(y*)`.  \nSince `y*` is optimal, no smaller cost exists, so the returned value\nequals the optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Complexity Analysis\n\n* Floyd‑Warshall: `O(26³)` ≈ `1.8·10⁴` operations, negligible.\n* Processing the string: `O(n)` time, `O(1)` extra memory.\n* Total time: `O(n + 26³)`  \n  Total memory: `O(26²)` for the distance matrix, plus `O(1)`.\n\nBoth satisfy the constraints (`n ≤ 10⁵`).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimal possible length.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nIf the algorithm finishes the loop without using a divisor pair,\nthe array can be reduced to a single positive number.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nDuring the loop every iteration removes two numbers and inserts a positive\nnumber (because the pair is not a divisor pair).\nThus the number of positive numbers decreases by one each iteration.\nWhen the loop ends, at most one positive number remains.\nNo zeros were produced, so the final array contains exactly that one positive\nnumber. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf the algorithm cannot find a non‑divisor pair for some `i`,\nthen any sequence of operations must create at least one zero.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nAssume the contrary: there exists a sequence of operations that never\ncreates a zero.  \nConsider the moment when the algorithm is stuck at index `i`.\nAll numbers with indices `< i` have already been paired with some\nnumber `> i` and removed.\nAll numbers with indices `> i` are still present and none of them\nis a multiple of `a[i]` (otherwise the algorithm would have paired\n`a[i]` with that number).\nHence every remaining number is a divisor of `a[i]` or is not a divisor\nof `a[i]`.  \nIf there were a number that is not a divisor of `a[i]`, the algorithm\nwould have paired `a[i]` with it, contradicting the assumption that it\nis stuck.  \nTherefore every remaining number is a divisor of `a[i]`.  \nConsequently any pair chosen among the remaining numbers will contain a\ndivisor pair, producing a zero – contradiction. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf the algorithm finishes with a single positive number,\nthe minimal possible length is `1`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the array can be reduced to a single positive number.\nNo operation can reduce the length below `1`, so `1` is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf the algorithm finishes with a zero produced,\nthe minimal possible length is `2`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 at least one zero must be produced in any sequence of\noperations.  \nAfter all possible operations are performed, at least one zero remains.\nThe only way to reduce the length further would be to delete that zero,\nwhich is impossible.  \nThus the minimal length is at least `2`.  \nThe algorithm itself produces exactly one zero and leaves one positive\nnumber, so length `2` is achievable and therefore optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the minimal possible length of the array.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nTwo cases:\n\n1.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns exactly the set of beautiful indices.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \n`listA` (resp. `listB`) contains **all** indices `i` such that  \n`s[i … i+|a|-1] == a` (resp. `s[j … j+|b|-1] == b`).\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe loops iterate over every possible start position of a substring of length `|a|` (or `|b|`).  \nThe equality test is exact, so an index is added iff the substring equals the pattern. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor any index `i` in `listA`, the algorithm declares `i` beautiful  \niff there exists an index `j` in `listB` with `|i-j| ≤ k`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*If the algorithm declares `i` beautiful.*  \nIt found a candidate `j` in `listB` (either `idx` or `idx-1`) with `|i-j| ≤ k`.  \nThus such a `j` exists.\n\n*If such a `j` exists.*  \nLet `j*` be the closest `b`‑position to `i`.  \nBecause `listB` is sorted, `j*` is either the first element not smaller than `i`\n(`idx`) or the element just before it (`idx-1`).  \nThe algorithm checks both candidates, so it will find `j*` and therefore\ndeclare `i` beautiful. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns exactly the set of beautiful indices of `s`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*Soundness:*  \nTake any index `i` returned by the algorithm.  \nBy construction `i ∈ listA`, so `s[i … i+|a|-1] == a`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2, there exists `j ∈ listB` with `|i-j| ≤ k`.  \nThus `i` satisfies the definition of a beautiful index.\n\n*Completeness:*  \nTake any beautiful index `i`.  \nBy definition, `s[i … i+|a|-1] == a`, so by Lemma&nbsp;1, `i ∈ listA`.  \nAlso there exists `j` with `s[j … j+|b|-1] == b` and `|i-j| ≤ k`.  \nHence `j ∈ listB`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the algorithm will declare `i` beautiful and therefore include it\nin the output.\n\nSince every returned index is beautiful and every beautiful index is returned,\nthe algorithm is correct. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.  Complexity Analysis\n\n*Finding occurrences:* `O(n)` time, `O(n)` memory for the two lists.  \n*Testing each `a`‑position:* `O(|listA| log |listB|)` time.  \nWith `|listA|, |listB| ≤ n`, the total time is `O(n log n)` in the worst case,\nwell within the limits.  \nThe output list uses `O(|listA|)` additional memory.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Observations\n\n* `AND` never increases a bit:  \n  `x & y` has a bit set only if both `x` and `y` have it set.\n* `OR` is monotone: if `a ≤ b` (bitwise) then `a | c ≤ b | c`.\n\nBecause of the second point, **merging two adjacent segments can never increase\nthe final OR** – it can only keep it the same or decrease it.\nTherefore, to obtain the minimum possible OR we will use *exactly* `k`\noperations, i.e. we will split the array into\n\n```\nm = n - k\n```\n\ncontiguous segments.  \n(Using fewer operations would give more segments and a larger OR.)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.   Feasibility test for a candidate OR\n\nFor a fixed integer `X` we ask:\n\n> *Can we split the array into at least `m` segments such that the AND of\n> every segment is a sub‑set of `X`?*  \n> (i.e. `segment_and & ~X == 0` or simply `segment_and ≤ X`)\n\nIf this is possible, we can merge some of the segments (merging keeps the\ncondition) until we have exactly `m` segments, so `X` is a feasible answer.\n\n**Greedy construction of the maximum number of segments**\n\n```\nsegments = 0\ni = 0\nwhile i < n:\n    cur_and = nums[i]\n    j = i + 1\n    while cur_and > X and j < n:\n        cur_and &= nums[j]\n        j += 1\n    if cur_and > X:          # even the whole suffix cannot satisfy the condition\n        return False\n    segments += 1\n    i = j                    # start next segment\nreturn segments >= m\n```\n\n*Why is it optimal?*  \n`cur_and` only decreases when we extend the segment.  \nAs soon as it becomes `≤ X` we stop – any longer segment would only reduce\nthe number of segments.  \nThus the greedy algorithm produces the **maximum** possible number of\nsegments for this `X`.\n\nThe test runs in `O(n)` time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Bitwise binary search\n\n`X` is at most `2^30-1`.  \nWe build the answer bit by bit from the most significant bit to the least\nsignificant bit.\n\n```\nans = 0\nfor bit from 29 down to 0:\n    candidate = ans          # keep this bit 0\n    if feasible(candidate):\n        # bit can stay 0\n        continue\n    else:\n        ans |= (1 << bit)    # we must set this bit\nreturn ans\n```\n\nAt most 30 iterations, each calling the `feasible` test (`O(n)`), so the total\ntime is `O(30 · n)` – easily fast enough for `n ≤ 10^5`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible OR.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any array `A` and any two adjacent segments `S1, S2` with values\n`a = AND(S1)` and `b = AND(S2)`,  \n`(a & b) | rest ≤ (a | b) | rest`, where `rest` is the OR of all other\nsegments.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n`a & b` is a sub‑set of both `a` and `b` (bitwise).  \nBecause `OR` is monotone,  \n`(a & b) | rest ≤ a | rest` and also `≤ b | rest`.  \nSince `a | rest` and `b | rest` are both ≤ `(a | b) | rest`,\nthe inequality follows. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nLet `m = n - k`.  \nAmong all ways to perform at most `k` operations, the minimum possible OR is\nachieved by performing exactly `k` operations (i.e. using exactly `m`\nsegments).\n\n**Proof.**\n\nAssume an optimal solution uses fewer than `k` operations, hence more than\n`m` segments.  \nTake any two adjacent segments of this solution and merge them.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the OR does not increase.\nRepeating this until exactly `m` segments remain yields a solution with\nthe same or smaller OR that uses exactly `k` operations. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a fixed integer `X` the greedy procedure described in section&nbsp;2\nproduces the maximum possible number of segments whose AND is `≤ X`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nConsider the greedy construction.  \nWhen a segment starts at index `i`, the algorithm extends it until the\nAND first becomes `≤ X`.  \nAny shorter segment would have AND `> X` and would be invalid.\nAny longer segment would reduce the number of remaining segments.\nThus the greedy choice is optimal for the current segment.\nBy induction over the segments, the whole construction yields the maximum\nnumber of valid segments. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \n`feasible(X)` returns *true* iff there exists a partition of the array into\nat least `m` segments such that the AND of each segment is `≤ X`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*If part:*  \nIf such a partition exists, the greedy algorithm can only produce a number\nof segments **not smaller** than that partition (Lemma&nbsp;3).  \nHence it will produce at least `m` segments and return *true*.\n\n*Only if part:*  \nIf the greedy algorithm returns *true*, it has produced a partition into\nat least `m` segments with each segment AND `≤ X`.  \nThus such a partition exists. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nLet `ans` be the value returned by the bitwise search.  \nThen `ans` is feasible, i.e. there exists a partition into at least `m`\nsegments with each segment AND `≤ ans`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nDuring the search we only set a bit to `1` when the candidate with that bit\nkept `0` is *not* feasible.  \nTherefore after processing all bits, the final `ans` satisfies\n`feasible(ans) == true`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 this means the required partition exists. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 6  \nNo integer smaller than `ans` is feasible.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nAssume there exists `Y < ans` that is feasible.  \nLet `b` be the most significant bit where `ans` and `Y` differ.\nDuring the search, when processing bit `b` the candidate with this bit\nkept `0` was *not* feasible, otherwise the algorithm would have left the\nbit `0`.  \nBut `Y` has this bit `0`, contradicting the assumption that `Y` is\nfeasible. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`ans` returned by the algorithm equals the minimum possible value of the\nbitwise OR of the remaining elements after at most `k` operations.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;5, `ans` is achievable, so the minimum is **at most** `ans`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;6, no smaller value is achievable, so the minimum is **at\nleast** `ans`.  \nTherefore the minimum equals `ans`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Choosing the marking seconds\n\nFor an index `i` we are free to choose any second in which it appears.\nChoosing a **later** second gives more time for its decrements, therefore\nnever hurts feasibility.\n\nConsequently, if a schedule exists at all, a schedule that uses for every\nindex the **latest** possible second is also feasible.\nIf the latest‑second schedule violates (1) for some `k`, no other schedule\ncan satisfy (1).\n\nSo the whole problem reduces to:\n\n*For a given `s` compute the latest second `d_i` for every index `i`\nand check condition (1).*\n\nIf it holds, `s` is a valid answer; otherwise we try the next `s`.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the earliest second in which all\nindices can be marked, or `-1` if impossible.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed second `s` and a fixed set of marking seconds `d_i`\nthe schedule exists **iff** condition (1) holds for all `k (1 ≤ k ≤ s)`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*Necessity.*  \nAssume a schedule exists.  \nConsider any `k`.  \nAll operations that finish not later than `k` are exactly the\n`nums[i]` decrements of indices with `d_i ≤ k` and the `1` marking of\nthose indices.  \nThe schedule uses at most `k` operations in the first `k` seconds, hence\ntheir total number cannot exceed `k`.  \nThus (1) holds.\n\n*Sufficiency.*  \nAssume (1) holds for all `k`.  \nWe construct a schedule by the standard greedy algorithm for unit jobs\nwith deadlines:\n\n```\nfor t = 1 … s\n        if there is an index i with d_i = t\n                schedule its marking in second t\n        schedule as many decrements as possible in second t\n```\n\nBecause (1) guarantees that at every prefix `k` the total required work\ndoes not exceed `k`, the greedy algorithm never runs out of time.\nAll decrements of an index finish before its marking second, so the\nschedule is valid. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf a schedule exists for some second `s`, then a schedule exists that\nuses for every index `i` the latest possible marking second\n`d_i = last[i]` (the latest occurrence of `i` in `changeIndices[1…s]`).\n\n**Proof.**\n\nTake any feasible schedule.  \nIf an index `i` is marked earlier than its latest occurrence,\nmove its marking to the latest occurrence.\nAll its decrements are still finished before the new marking second,\nbecause the new second is later.\nThe other indices are unaffected.\nRepeating this for every index yields a schedule that uses all latest\noccurrences. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a fixed `s` the algorithm returns *true* (i.e. `ok` remains `true`)\n**iff** there exists a feasible schedule for second `s`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*If part.*  \nThe algorithm checks condition (1) for the latest occurrences\n`d_i = last[i]`.  \nIf it returns *true*, (1) holds for all `k`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 a schedule exists for these `d_i`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 a schedule exists for second `s`.  \n\n*Only if part.*  \nAssume a schedule exists for second `s`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 a schedule exists that uses the latest occurrences.\nFor those `d_i` condition (1) must hold (Lemma&nbsp;1).  \nThe algorithm checks exactly this condition, therefore it will not\ndetect a violation and will return *true*. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nLet `s*` be the smallest second for which a feasible schedule exists.\nThe algorithm returns `s*`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe algorithm tests `s = 1, 2, …, m` in increasing order.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 it returns *true* exactly for those `s` that admit a\nfeasible schedule.\nTherefore the first `s` for which it returns *true* is precisely `s*`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm outputs\n\n* the earliest second in which all indices can be marked, or\n* `-1` if it is impossible.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nIf a feasible schedule exists, let `s*` be the earliest second.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm returns `s*`.  \nIf no feasible schedule exists, the algorithm never returns *true* and\nfinally outputs `-1`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible length.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed base `x ≠ 1` the algorithm considers every possible exponent\n`e = 2^i` that can appear in a valid pattern for `x`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe loop starts with `val = x = x^(2^0)` and multiplies `val` by itself each\niteration, producing `x^(2^1), x^(2^2), …`.  \nThe loop stops when `val > 10⁹`, which is exactly the first exponent that\ncannot appear in any pattern because all numbers in `nums` are ≤ `10⁹`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nDuring the loop for a fixed base `x ≠ 1`,  \n`prev_ok` is `True` **iff** all exponents `< 2^i` can be used in a pattern\nwith largest exponent `2^i`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*Initialization:*  \nBefore the first iteration (`i = 0`) no exponent has been processed,\nso the statement is vacuously true.\n\n*Induction step:*  \nAssume the statement holds for exponent `2^i`.  \nFor exponent `2^(i+1)` we need two copies of `x^(2^i)` to use it as a\nnon‑largest exponent.  \nThe algorithm sets `prev_ok` to `True` exactly when `cnt ≥ 2`.  \nThus after the update, `prev_ok` is `True` precisely when all exponents\n`< 2^(i+1)` satisfy the requirement. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nWhenever the algorithm updates `answer` with `2*i + 1`,\nthere exists a valid pattern of that length for base `x`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe update happens only if `prev_ok` is `True` and `cnt ≥ 1`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2, `prev_ok = True` guarantees that all exponents `< 2^i`\nhave at least two copies.  \n`cnt ≥ 1` guarantees that the current exponent `2^i` has at least one copy,\nso it can be the largest exponent.  \nTherefore the pattern consisting of exponents `0 … i` satisfies all\nrequirements and has length `2*i + 1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor a fixed base `x ≠ 1` the algorithm records the maximum possible\nlength of a pattern using `x`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet `L` be the maximum achievable length for base `x`.  \nLet `k` be the largest exponent index in that pattern (`2^k` is the largest\nexponent).  \nDuring the iteration with `i = k` the algorithm satisfies the conditions of\nLemma&nbsp;3, so it updates `answer` to at least `2*k + 1 = L`.  \nNo later iteration can produce a larger length because it would require\nan exponent `> 2^k`, which is impossible by definition of `k`.  \nThus the maximum length for base `x` is recorded. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nFor base `1` the algorithm records the maximum possible length.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nAll powers of `1` equal `1`.  \nA pattern with `m` exponents (`0 … m`) needs `2*m + 1` copies of `1`.  \nThe largest `m` satisfying this is `(cnt[1] - 1) // 2`.  \nThe algorithm computes exactly this value and updates `answer` with\n`2*m + 1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the maximum number of elements that can be selected\nfrom `nums` to form a pattern of the required form.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nFor every possible base `x` (including `x = 1`) the algorithm\nrecords the maximum achievable length for that base\n(Lemmas&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;5).  \n`answer` is the maximum over all bases, therefore it equals the overall\nmaximum possible length. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Global resources\n\nFrom the whole multiset of letters we can build\n\n```\nP = Σ floor(cnt[c] / 2)          # total number of pairs that exist\nS = Σ cnt[c] mod 2              # total number of single letters that already exist\n```\n\nIf we decide to make some words palindromes we must\n\n```\nΣ p_i  ≤  P                                 (1)   – pairs are not enough\nΣ o_i  ≤  S + 2 * (P – Σ p_i)                (2)   – singles are not enough\n```\n\n`(P – Σ p_i)` pairs are left after allocating the required pairs.\nEach remaining pair can be broken into two singles, therefore the\nright hand side of (2) is the number of singles that are available\nafter the pair allocation.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Greedy choice\n\nWe want to maximise the number of chosen words.\nAll words have the same “value” (1), only the two resources differ.\nFor a word\n\n```\np_i  – pairs it needs\no_i  – singles it needs\n```\n\nIf a word with larger `p_i` is chosen before a word with smaller\n`p_i`, we can swap the two words in any feasible solution –\nthe total number of pairs used does not increase, the number of\nsingles used does not increase either.  \nTherefore an optimal solution can be reordered so that the words are\nsorted by non‑decreasing `p_i`.\n\nFor equal `p_i` the word that needs fewer singles (`o_i`) is better,\nbecause it keeps more singles for the remaining words.\nSo we sort by `(p_i , o_i)`.\n\nAfter sorting we simply add words one by one while the two constraints\n(1) and (2) stay satisfied.  \nThe first word that would violate a constraint stops the process –\nadding any later word would only increase the resource consumption,\nhence no better solution exists.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible number of\npalindromic words.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nLet `A` and `B` be two words with `p_A ≤ p_B`.  \nIf a feasible set of words contains `B` but not `A`, then exchanging\n`B` by `A` keeps the set feasible.\n\n**Proof.**\n\n*Pairs*  \n`A` needs at most as many pairs as `B`.  \nReplacing `B` by `A` can only decrease the total number of pairs used,\nso constraint (1) stays satisfied.\n\n*Singles*  \n`A` needs at most as many singles as `B` (because `o_i` is 0 or 1).\nThe number of remaining pairs after the replacement does not increase,\nhence the number of available singles does not decrease.\nThus constraint (2) also stays satisfied. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nLet `A` and `B` be two words with `p_A = p_B` and `o_A ≤ o_B`.  \nIf a feasible set contains `B` but not `A`, then exchanging\n`B` by `A` keeps the set feasible.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nPairs are equal, so constraint (1) is unchanged.  \n`A` needs no more singles than `B`; the number of remaining pairs is\nunchanged, therefore the number of available singles does not decrease.\nConstraint (2) remains satisfied. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThere exists an optimal solution in which the chosen words are sorted\nby non‑decreasing `(p_i , o_i)`.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nTake any optimal solution.\nWhile it is not sorted, find the first pair of consecutive words that\nviolate the order.\nIf the first word has larger `p` than the second, apply Lemma&nbsp;1.\nIf the `p` values are equal but the first word needs more singles,\napply Lemma&nbsp;2.\nEach exchange keeps the solution feasible and does not reduce the\nnumber of chosen words.\nRepeating this process yields a sorted optimal solution. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nDuring the greedy scan the algorithm never skips a word that could be\nadded without violating the constraints.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nThe words are processed in the sorted order of Lemma&nbsp;3.\nAssume the algorithm stops before adding word `k`.\nAll previous words satisfy the constraints, so the current totals are\n`P_used = Σ_{i<k} p_i` and `S_used = Σ_{i<k} o_i`.\n\nAdding word `k` would violate at least one constraint:\n\n```\nP_used + p_k  >  P          or\nS_used + o_k  >  S + 2*(P - (P_used + p_k))\n```\n\nBecause the words are sorted, any later word `j > k` satisfies\n`p_j ≥ p_k` and `o_j ≥ o_k` (or at least not smaller in the same\n`p` group).  \nThus adding `j` would violate the same or a stricter constraint.\nHence no later word can be added either. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the maximum possible number of palindromic words.\n\n**Proof.**\n\nLet `G` be the set of words chosen by the algorithm.\nBy construction `G` satisfies both constraints, so it is feasible.\n\nAssume there exists a feasible set `F` with more words than `G`.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 we may reorder `F` so that it is sorted by\n`(p_i , o_i)`.  \nWhen the algorithm scans the words, it will encounter the same\nsequence of words in the same order.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm would not stop before adding a word that\n`F` contains, contradicting that `F` has more words than `G`.  \nTherefore no feasible set can contain more words than `G`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.
