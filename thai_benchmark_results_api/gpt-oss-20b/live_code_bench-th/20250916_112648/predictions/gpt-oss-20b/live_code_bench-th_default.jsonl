But the user might want a function that can generate a function body from a prompt. So we can provide a function that takes a prompt string and returns a function body string. That is a generic solution. But the user might want something else.\n\nGiven the instruction, we should respond with a function body. But we need to decide what function. Let's propose a function that takes a prompt and returns a function body string. That is a generic code generation function. We can call it generate_function_body(prompt). It will return a string. We can include a placeholder for the actual code generation logic. That satisfies the requirement: \"Generate an executable Python function generated from the given prompt.\" But we don't have a prompt. So we can provide a function that can be used to generate code from a prompt. That is a meta function.\n\nThus, we can provide:\n\ndef generate_function_body(prompt: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a Python function body from a natural language prompt.\n    This is a placeholder implementation. Replace with actual code generation logic.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Example: simple echo function\n    return f\"def generated_function():\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"{prompt}\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    pass\"\n\nBut that might not be what they want. But it's a safe generic answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can ask for clarification. But the instruction says \"Generate an executable Python function generated from the given prompt.\" There's no prompt. So we can ask for clarification. But the user might want a function that can generate code from a prompt. So we can provide that.\n\nI'll provide a function that takes a prompt and returns a function body string. That is a generic solution. I'll include docstring. That is the function body. I'll not invoke it. I'll just provide the function definition.

Possibly they want a function that can generate a function from a prompt? Or maybe they want a function that returns the function body? The instruction is ambiguous. They repeated the same sentence twice. They want a function body that is executable. But no specific functionality is described. Maybe they want a generic function that can generate a function from a prompt? Or maybe they want a function that returns the function body of a function that is generated from a prompt. But we don't have a prompt.\n\nWe need to ask for clarification? The user didn't provide a prompt. The instruction: \"Generate an executable Python function generated from the given prompt. Return the function body without invoking it at the final solution.\" So we need to produce a function body. But we need to know what the function should do. Since no prompt, we could produce a placeholder function that does nothing or returns a string. But that seems unsatisfactory.\n\nWe could interpret that the user wants a function that can generate a function from a prompt. So we can write a function that takes a prompt string and returns a function body string. That might satisfy. But the user says \"Generate an executable Python function generated from the given prompt.\" That could be a meta function: given a prompt, generate a function. So we can write a function that takes a prompt and returns a function body string. That is executable. But we need to return the function body without invoking it. So we can just provide the function definition.\n\nThus we can produce something like:\n\ndef generate_function_from_prompt(prompt: str) -> str:\n    # logic to parse prompt and generate function body\n    # For demonstration, just return a simple function body\n    return f\"def generated_function():\\n    return \\\"{prompt}\\\"\"\n\nBut that might not be what they want. Alternatively, we can produce a function that prints the prompt.

The user says \"Generate an executable Python function generated from the given prompt.\" But no prompt is given. So we need to interpret. Possibly they want a function that can generate a function from a prompt? Or maybe they want a function that returns the function body? The instruction is ambiguous. They repeated the same sentence twice. They want a function body that is executable. But no specific functionality is described. Maybe they want a generic function that can generate a function from a prompt? Or maybe they want a function that returns the function body of a function that is generated from a prompt. But we don't have a prompt.\n\nWe need to ask for clarification? The user didn't provide a prompt. The instruction: \"Generate an executable Python function generated from the given prompt. Return the function body without invoking it at the final solution.\" So we need to produce a function body. But we need to know what the function should do. Since no prompt, we could produce a placeholder function that does nothing or returns a string. But that seems unsatisfactory.\n\nWe could interpret that the user wants a function that can generate a function from a prompt. So we can write a function that takes a prompt string and returns a function body string. That might satisfy. But the user says \"Generate an executable Python function generated from the given prompt.\" That could be a meta function: given a prompt, generate a function. So we can write a function that takes a prompt and returns a function body string. That is executable. But we need to return the function body without invoking it. So we can just provide the function definition.\n\nThus we can produce something like:\n\ndef generate_function_from_prompt(prompt: str) -> str:\n    # logic to parse prompt and generate function body\n    # For demonstration, just return a simple function body\n    return f\"def generated_function():\\n    return \\\"{prompt}\\\"\"\n\nBut that might not be what they want. Alternatively, we can produce a function that prints the prompt. But the user didn't specify.\n\nGiven the lack of specifics, we can produce a generic function that takes a prompt and returns a function body string. That is an executable function. We can also include docstring. That should satisfy.\n\nWe need to return the function body only, not the invocation. So we just output the function definition.\n\nThus final answer: a function named generate_function_from_prompt that returns a string containing a function body. That is executable.
