The question: \"กำหนดให้ U แทนเอกภพสัมพัทธ์ และ A, B, C เป็นสับเซตของ U โดยที่แผนภาพแสดงเซต U, A, B และ C มีส่วนที่แรเงาดังรูป\" So the diagram shows U, A, B, C with shaded region.

Let's analyze each expression:\n\n- B ∩ (A - C): elements in B that are in A but not in C. So intersection of B with A minus C. So region inside both B and A, but not in C.\n\n- B ∩ (C - A): elements in B that are in C but not in A. So region inside B and C, but not in A.\n\n- B - (A ∩ C): elements in B that are not in both A and C simultaneously. So B minus the intersection of A and C. That is B minus the region that is in both A and C. So includes all of B except the part that is in both A and C. So includes B∩A∩C? Wait B minus (A∩C) removes elements that are in both A and C. So if an element is in B and also in A∩C, it's removed. So the remaining includes B∩(A∩C)^c. That includes B∩(A^c ∪ C^c). So includes B∩A^c (B but not A) plus B∩C^c (B but not C) plus B∩A^c∩C^c (both not). But note that B∩A∩C is removed.
