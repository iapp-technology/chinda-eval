The question: \"กำหนดให้ U แทนเอกภพสัมพัทธ์ และ A, B, C เป็นสับเซตของ U โดยที่แผนภาพแสดงเซต U, A, B และ C มีส่วนที่แรเงาดังรูป\" So the diagram shows U, A, B, C with shaded region. We need to identify which set expression matches the shaded region. Without the image, we need guess. But maybe the shading is a particular region. Let's think: The options:\n\n1) B ∩ (A - C)\n2) B ∩ (C - A)\n3) B - (A ∩ C)\n4) B - (A - C)\n5) B - (C - A)\n\nWe need to pick one. Let's analyze each expression:\n\n- B ∩ (A - C): elements in B that are in A but not in C. So intersection of B with A minus C. So region inside B and A but outside C.\n\n- B ∩ (C - A): elements in B that are in C but not in A. So region inside B and C but outside A.\n\n- B - (A ∩ C): elements in B that are not in both A and C. So B minus the intersection of A and C. That is B minus the region that is in both A and C. So includes all of B except the part that is in both A and C. So includes B∩A∩C? Wait B minus (A∩C) removes any element that is in both A and C, regardless of B. But if an element is in B and also in A∩C, then it's removed. So the remaining includes B∩(A∩C)^c. That is B∩(A^c ∪ C^c). So includes B∩A^c∪B∩C^c. So includes B∩A^c (B but not A) plus B∩C^c (B but not C). But note that B∩A^c and B∩C^c overlap? They overlap in B∩A^c∩C^c. So basically all of B except the part that is in both A and C. So includes B∩A∩C^c, B∩A^c∩C, B∩A^c∩C^c. So basically all B except B∩A∩C.\n\n- B - (A - C): B minus (A minus C). A minus C is elements in A but not in C. So B minus that removes from B any element that is in A but not in C. So remaining B includes B∩(A - C)^c = B∩(A^c ∪ C). So includes B∩A^c plus B∩C. So includes B∩A^c∩C^c? Wait B∩A^c∩C^c is included because A^c and C^c both true. B∩A^c∩C is included. B∩A∩C is included. So basically all B except B∩A∩C^c? Wait B∩(A - C) = B∩A∩C^c. So B minus that removes B∩A∩C^c. So remaining includes B∩A∩C, B∩A^c∩C, B∩A^c∩C^c. So all B except the part that is in A but not in C.\n\n- B - (C - A): B minus (C minus A). C minus A is elements in C but not in A.

Without the image, we need to guess typical shading. The shading might be the region that is in B but not in A or C? Or maybe the region that is in B and A but not C? Let's think typical exam question: They might shade the region that is in B but not in A or C. That would be B - (A ∪ C). But that's not an option. They might shade B ∩ (A - C) or B ∩ (C - A). Which one? Let's consider the options: They include B∩(A-C) and B∩(C-A). So maybe the shading is the part of B that is in A but not in C, or in C but not in A. Which one is more likely? The shading might be the part of B that is in A but not in C. That is B∩(A-C). Option 1. Or maybe the shading is the part of B that is in C but not in A. Option 2.\n\nAlternatively, shading might be B minus (A∩C). That would be all of B except the part that is in both A and C. That is a large region. But maybe the shading is that. But typical exam might ask to identify shading that is B minus (A∩C). But the shading might be the part of B that is not in both A and C. But that would be a large region. But the shading might be the part of B that is not in A or C? That would be B - (A ∪ C). But not given.\n\nLet's try to imagine the diagram: U is universal set. A, B, C are overlapping circles. The shading might be a region that is inside B but outside both A and C? That would be B - (A ∪ C). Not given. So maybe shading is inside B and A but outside C. That is B∩(A-C). Option 1. Or inside B and C but outside A. Option 2. Which one is more likely? Without image, we need guess. Let's think of typical exam: They might shade the region that is in B but not in A or C? But that is not given. So maybe they shade the region that is in B and A but not in C. That is B∩(A-C). Option 1. Let's choose that.\n\nBut we need to be careful: The shading might be B - (A-C). That is B minus (A minus C). That would be B minus the part of A that is not in C. So shading would be B minus that part. That would include B∩C plus B∩A^c. That might be a large region. But maybe the shading is that. But which one is more plausible? Let's think of typical Venn shading: They might shade the region that is in B but not in A. That would be B - A. But not given. They might shade B∩(A-C). That is a small region. They might shade B∩(C-A). That is also small. They might shade B - (A∩C). That is B minus the intersection of A and C. That is a large region. They might shade B - (A-C). That is B minus the part of A not in C. That is also large. They might shade B - (C-A). That is B minus the part of C not in A. That is also large.\n\nWhich one is more likely to be a single region? B∩(A-C) or B∩(C-A). Those are single region. The others are multiple. So likely shading is one of those. Which one? Without image, we guess. Let's think of typical exam: They might ask to identify shading that is B∩(A-C). That is a region inside B and A but outside C. That is a typical region. So answer (1).
