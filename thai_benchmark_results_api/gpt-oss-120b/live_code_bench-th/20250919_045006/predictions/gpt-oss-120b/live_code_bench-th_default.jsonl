Need to determine if there exists a substring (contiguous) of S that contains exactly W occurrences of 'w' and B occurrences of 'b'. Input: two integers W B? Actually sample input \"1 3 2\" maybe first number is test case count? Wait sample input 1: \"3 2\"? Actually they show \"Sample Input 1 3 2\". Possibly first line is W then B? The description: Input format: ??? It says \"Input will be given from standard input in the following format:\" but not shown due to translation. Likely just two integers W B. Sample Input 1: \"3 2\". Output Yes. Sample Input 2: \"3 0\". Output No. Sample Input 3: \"92 66\". Output Yes.\n\nThus we just read two ints W B.\n\nGoal: Determine if there exists a substring of infinite periodic string with pattern P = \"wbwwbwbwbwbw\". Length of pattern? Let's compute: characters: w b w w b w b w b w b w? Let's count: \"w b w w b w b w b w b w\" that's 12 characters. Let's verify: pattern = \"wbwwbwbwbwbw\". length 12.\n\nWe need to know possible counts of w and b in substrings of the infinite periodic string. Since it's periodic, any substring can be considered as some length L, and its composition depends on starting offset modulo 12.\n\nWe need to know if there exists any substring with exactly W w's and B b's. Equivalent to existence of a contiguous segment of the infinite periodic sequence with those counts.\n\nWe can treat the infinite string as periodic, so we can consider substrings up to some bound? Since W+B <= 200 (max 100+100). Actually constraints: W,B up to 100, sum >=1. So length L = W+B <=200. So we only need to consider substrings of length up to 200. Since pattern repeats, we can consider a finite window of length maybe 12*ceil(200/12)+12 = something like 12* (200/12 ~ 17) => 12*18=216. So we can generate S of length maybe 500 to be safe, and check all substrings up to length 200 for counts.\n\nSimpler: generate S of length maybe 12*20=240, then slide window of length L = W+B, for each start position compute counts. Since infinite, we also need to consider substrings that may cross many periods, but length limited to 200, so within 240 we cover all possible start offsets modulo 12 and enough periods to cover length.\n\nThus algorithm: read W,B. L = W+B. Generate S = pattern repeated enough times: repeat = (L // len(pattern)) + 3 maybe. Build S = pattern * repeat.

Let's verify: pattern = \"wbwwbwbwbwbw\". length 12.\n\nWe need to know possible counts of w and b in substrings of the infinite periodic string.

Equivalent to existence of a contiguous segment of the infinite periodic sequence with those counts.\n\nWe can treat the infinite string as periodic, so we can consider substrings up to some bound? Since W+B <= 200 (max 100+100). Actually constraints: W,B up to 100, sum >=1. So length L = W+B <=200. So we only need to consider substrings of length up to 200.

Good sequence is S(l,r) where there exist non-negative integers i,j such that l = 2^i * j and r = 2^i * (j+1). That means the length is 2^i, and l is multiple of 2^i. So intervals that are aligned to power-of-two boundaries (dyadic intervals). So we need to partition [L,R) into minimal number of dyadic intervals (power-of-two length, aligned). This is classic binary partition (like representing interval as union of minimal dyadic intervals). The greedy algorithm: start at L, while L < R: find largest power-of-two block that fits: let max_len = L & -L (lowest set bit) gives max alignment. Also limit by remaining length R-L. Choose block size = largest power of two <= remaining and also <= alignment. So size = 1 << floor(log2(min(remaining, L & -L)))? Actually we need largest power of two that divides L (i.e., alignment) and also not exceed remaining. So size = 1 << min(trailing_zeros(L), floor_log2(R-L)). Use while.\n\nCollect intervals (l, r). Output M then each pair.\n\nEdge case: L=0, L & -L = 0? Actually trailing zeros of 0 is infinite, but alignment for 0 is any power of two. So we can treat alignment as large (like 2^60). So size = largest power of two <= remaining. So we can just set tz = 60 (or 61). Use while.\n\nImplementation: read L,R from stdin (two ints). Compute intervals list.\n\nFunction solve(): read ints, compute list, print M then each l r.\n\nTest with examples.\n\nExample1: L=3,R=19. Compute: L=3 (binary 11), tz=0 (since L odd). remaining=16. max size = 1<<0 =1. interval (3,4). L=4, tz=2 (since 4=100). remaining=15. max size = min(2^2=4, largest power <=15 is 8) => size=4. interval (4,8). L=8 tz=3, remaining=11, max size = min(8,8)=8 => (8,16). L=16 tz=4, remaining=3, max size = min(16,2)=2 => (16,18). L=18 tz=1, remaining=1, size=1 => (18,19). Works.\n\nSecond example: L=0,R=1024. L=0 treat tz large, remaining=1024, size=1024 => (0,1024). M=1.\n\nThird example large numbers: should produce same as sample.\n\nImplementation details: compute trailing zeros: for x>0: (x & -x) gives lowest set bit value = 2^{tz}. So tz = (x & -x).bit_length()-1. For x=0, set tz = 60 (since max power 2^60). Actually R up to 2^60, so we can set max_pow = 1<<60. Use while.\n\nCompute max_pow_align = x & -x if x>0 else 1<<60. Then max_pow_len = 1 << (R-L).bit_length()-1 (largest power <= remaining). size = min(max_pow_align, max_pow_len). But need to ensure size is power of two.

Good sequence is S(l,r) where there exist non-negative integers i,j such that l = 2^i * j and r = 2^i * (j+1). That means the length is 2^i, and l is multiple of 2^i. So intervals that are aligned to power-of-two boundaries (dyadic intervals). So we need to partition [L,R) into minimal number of dyadic intervals (power-of-two length, aligned). This is classic binary partition (like representing interval as union of minimal dyadic intervals). The greedy algorithm: start at L, while L < R: find largest power-of-two block that fits: let max_len = L & -L (lowest set bit) gives max alignment. Also limit by remaining length R-L. Choose block size = largest power of two <= remaining and also <= alignment. So size = 1 << floor(log2(min(remaining, L & -L)))? Actually we need largest power of two that divides L (i.e., alignment) and also not exceed remaining. So size = 1 << min(trailing_zeros(L), floor_log2(R-L)). Use while.\n\nCollect intervals (l, r). Output M then each pair.\n\nEdge case: L=0, L & -L = 0? Actually trailing zeros of 0 is infinite, but alignment for 0 is any power of two. So we can treat alignment as large (like 2^60). So size = largest power of two <= remaining. So we can just set tz = 60 (or 61). Use while.\n\nImplementation: read L,R from stdin (two ints). Compute intervals list.\n\nFunction solve(): read ints, compute list, print M then each l r.\n\nTest with examples.\n\nExample1: L=3,R=19. Compute: L=3 (binary 11), tz=0 (since L odd). remaining=16. max size = 1<<0 =1. interval (3,4). L=4, tz=2 (since 4=100). remaining=15. max size = min(2^2=4, largest power <=15 is 8) => size=4. interval (4,8). L=8 tz=3, remaining=11, max size = min(8,8)=8 => (8,16). L=16 tz=4, remaining=3, max size = min(16,2)=2 => (16,18). L=18 tz=1, remaining=1, size=1 => (18,19). Works.\n\nSecond example: L=0,R=1024. L=0 treat tz large, remaining=1024, size=1024 => (0,1024). M=1.\n\nThird example large numbers: should produce same as sample.\n\nImplementation details: compute trailing zeros: for x>0: (x & -x) gives lowest set bit value = 2^{tz}. So tz = (x & -x).bit_length()-1. For x=0, set tz = 60 (since max power 2^60). Actually R up to 2^60, so we can set max_pow = 1<<60. Use while.\n\nCompute max_pow_align = x & -x if x>0 else 1<<60. Then max_pow_len = 1 << (R-L).bit_length()-1 (largest power <= remaining). size = min(max_pow_align, max_pow_len). But need to ensure size is power of two. Both are powers of two, min works.\n\nEdge: if max_pow_align > remaining, then size = max_pow_len (since max_pow_len <= remaining).

That's a complete subgraph (clique) with uniform weight.\n\nAfter all operations, we need to check if the overall graph is connected. If not, print -1. If connected, compute total weight of Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of G.\n\nConstraints: N up to 2e5, total sum K_i up to 4e5, M up to 2e5. Adding all edges naively would be huge because each operation adds K_i*(K_i-1)/2 edges, which could be massive. Need to compute MST efficiently using the structure: edges are added in batches of equal weight cliques.\n\nObservation: Since all edges in a batch have same weight, we can treat them as potential edges for Kruskal. We need to process edges in increasing weight order. For each batch weight C_i, we have a set of vertices S_i; we need to consider adding edges connecting components within S_i. In Kruskal, we would add edges that connect different DSU components. For a clique, the minimal number of edges needed to connect all components present in S_i is (number of distinct DSU components in S_i) - 1, each of weight C_i. So we can process each batch: find the set of DSU roots for vertices in S_i, then union them, adding weight C_i * (cnt-1). However, careful: after processing earlier lower weight batches, some vertices may already be in same component, reducing needed edges.\n\nThus algorithm: sort operations by weight C_i ascending (if equal weight, order doesn't matter). For each operation, we need to consider its set S_i. We need to efficiently get distinct roots among S_i. Since total sum K_i is 4e5, we can iterate over each vertex in S_i, find its root, collect unique roots (e.g., using a set). Then if number of unique roots >1, we add (cnt-1)*C_i to answer, and union all those roots (e.g., union first root with each other). Complexity: O(total K_i * α(N)) plus sorting M (2e5). Acceptable.\n\nAfter processing all operations, we need to check if graph is connected: i.e., DSU has one component. If not, output -1.\n\nEdge case: there may be multiple operations with same weight; order among them doesn't affect final MST weight because Kruskal can process any order within same weight. Our method works.\n\nImplementation details: read ints from stdin. Input format: first line N M. Then for each i: K_i C_i followed by K_i integers. So we need to read sequentially.\n\nWe'll store list of tuples (C_i, S_i). Since sum K_i up to 4e5, storing all sets is okay.\n\nThen sort by C_i.\n\nDSU implementation with path compression and union by size.\n\nProcessing: for each (C, S): create list roots = [] ; for v in S: r = find(v); if r not in seen set: add to list and set. After loop, cnt = len(roots).

That's a complete subgraph (clique) with uniform weight.\n\nAfter all operations, we need to check if the overall graph is connected. If not, print -1. If connected, compute total weight of Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of G.\n\nConstraints: N up to 2e5, total sum K_i up to 4e5, M up to 2e5. Adding all edges naively would be huge because each operation adds K_i*(K_i-1)/2 edges, which could be massive. Need to compute MST efficiently using the structure: edges are added in batches of equal weight cliques.\n\nObservation: Since all edges in a batch have same weight, we can treat them as potential edges for Kruskal. We need to process edges in increasing weight order. For each batch weight C_i, we have a set of vertices S_i; we need to consider adding edges connecting components within S_i. In Kruskal, we would add edges that connect different DSU components. For a clique, the minimal number of edges needed to connect all components present in S_i is (number of distinct DSU components in S_i) - 1, each of weight C_i. So we can process each batch: find the set of DSU roots for vertices in S_i, then union them, adding weight C_i * (cnt-1). However, careful: after processing earlier lower weight batches, some vertices may already be in same component, reducing needed edges.\n\nThus algorithm: sort operations by weight C_i ascending (if equal weight, order doesn't matter). For each operation, we need to consider its set S_i. We need to efficiently get distinct roots among S_i. Since total sum K_i is 4e5, we can iterate over each vertex in S_i, find its root, collect unique roots (e.g., using a set). Then if number of unique roots >1, we add (cnt-1)*C_i to answer, and union all those roots (e.g., union first root with each other). Complexity: O(total K_i * α(N)) plus sorting M (2e5). Acceptable.\n\nAfter processing all operations, we need to check if graph is connected: i.e., DSU has one component. If not, output -1.\n\nEdge case: there may be multiple operations with same weight; order among them doesn't affect final MST weight because Kruskal can process any order within same weight. Our method works.\n\nImplementation details: read ints from stdin. Input format: first line N M. Then for each i: K_i C_i followed by K_i integers. So we need to read sequentially.\n\nWe'll store list of tuples (C_i, S_i). Since sum K_i up to 4e5, storing all sets is okay.\n\nThen sort by C_i.\n\nDSU implementation with path compression and union by size.\n\nProcessing: for each (C, S): create list roots = [] ; for v in S: r = find(v); if r not in seen set: add to list and set.

Starting energy 0. Moving costs 1 energy per step, cannot move if energy 0. At any cell with a medicine (given list), you may use it (once) to set energy to E_i, and the medicine disappears. You can also choose not to use it. Need to see if can reach T.\n\nState includes position and current energy, and which medicines have been used. N up to 300, grid up to 200x200 = 40000 cells. Energy max up to H*W <= 40000. Full state space huge.\n\nObservation: Using a medicine sets energy to a specific value, regardless of previous energy. So you might as well use a medicine when you have low energy, to reset to higher. Since medicines are consumable, order matters.\n\nWe can think of this as a graph where nodes are cells, edges cost 1 energy. Energy acts like a resource that depletes with steps, can be refilled to specific levels at certain nodes (once). This is similar to reachability with limited fuel and stations that set fuel to a given amount.\n\nWe can treat each medicine as a \"refuel\" to a fixed amount. Since you can only set to that amount, not add, you might waste leftover energy.\n\nWe can model as BFS over (cell, used_mask) but N=300 impossible.\n\nAlternative: Since using a medicine resets energy to E, you could think of it as you can \"jump\" to any state with energy = E at that cell, after which you can move up to E steps before needing another medicine.\n\nThus the problem reduces to: Is there a path from S to T such that the path can be partitioned into segments, each segment length <= E_i where the segment starts at a cell that either is S (with initial energy 0, so first segment must start with a medicine at S) or at a medicine cell where you use that medicine, and the segment ends at either T or another medicine cell where you use next medicine. Also you can pass through other medicine cells without using them.\n\nBut you can also use a medicine at a cell you arrive with some remaining energy; using it discards remaining energy and sets to E_i.\n\nThus we need to see if there exists a sequence of medicines (including possibly none) such that distances between consecutive used points (including start S and end T) are <= respective energy after using at start of segment.\n\nAt start, energy 0, so you must use a medicine at S if there is one; otherwise cannot move. So if S has a medicine, you can start with its E. If not, impossible unless S==T (but distinct). So first check if there is medicine at S.\n\nSimilarly, you can only move if you have energy >0, so you must have a medicine before moving.\n\nThus we can treat each medicine location (including S if medicine) as nodes, plus T as target node (no medicine). Edge from node i to node j if distance between their cells <= E_i (energy after using medicine i). You can also go from i to T if distance <= E_i. You can also go from i to another medicine j without using j, but you could later use j after arriving there (maybe with leftover energy). However you could also arrive at j with some remaining energy, and then decide to use j (reset). So edge from i to j exists if distance <= E_i (you can reach j). Then at j you can optionally use its medicine, giving new energy E_j for next segment.\n\nThus we have a directed graph where nodes are medicines (including possibly S) and we have start node representing using medicine at S (if exists). Actually you must use the medicine at S to start moving, so start state is after using that medicine. If there are multiple medicines at S? Input says each cell can have at most one medicine (since positions distinct). So at most one.\n\nThus we can BFS/DFS over medicines: start from S (if medicine there) with its E. Then we can reach any medicine j where dist <= current E. When we reach j, we can then use its medicine (reset to E_j) and continue. Also we can reach T directly if dist <= current E.\n\nThus we need to compute distances between all pairs of relevant cells (medicines + S + T). Grid up to 40000 cells, medicines up to 300, so total nodes up to 302. Compute shortest path distances on grid with obstacles using BFS from each node (O(K * HW) = 300*40000=12M, okay). Use BFS for each node to compute distances to all cells, then extract distances to other nodes.\n\nThen run BFS/DFS on directed graph: from start node (S) if medicine exists else impossible. Use visited set for medicines to avoid loops. Since using a medicine consumes it, you cannot reuse same medicine later (since it's gone). So each medicine can be used at most once. Graph traversal should respect that you cannot revisit a used medicine. But you could pass through a medicine cell without using it earlier, then later use it? That would require you to not have used it before, which is okay. Our graph model assumes you only use medicine when you arrive at its node as a step. If you pass through without using, you could later come back and use it, but that would be a different path. Since we are searching for any path, we can consider using a medicine at first arrival (since using later would waste steps). Might be okay to assume you use it when you first arrive because using later only reduces options. So we can treat each medicine as used when you first reach it.\n\nThus simple BFS over medicines works.\n\nEdge case: there could be medicine at S, but you could also not use it? Starting energy 0, can't move, so must use it.\n\nIf no medicine at S, answer No unless S==T (not possible). So early check.\n\nImplementation steps:\n\n- Read H,W.\n- Read grid lines.\n- Locate S and T.\n- Read N.\n- For i in range(N): read R,C,E. Convert to 0-index.\n- Build list of nodes: each medicine with its position and E. Also include S as a node? Actually S may also have a medicine; we need its E. If S has a medicine, we treat that as start node with its E. If not, impossible.\n- Also need T position (no E).\n- Compute distances from each medicine node (including possibly S) to all cells via BFS. Since we only need distances to other medicine nodes and T, we can stop BFS when all reached, but simpler compute full BFS.\n\n- Build adjacency: for each medicine i, for each medicine j (i!=j), if dist[i][pos_j] <= E_i then edge i->j. Also if dist[i][T] <= E_i then can reach target.\n\n- Perform BFS/DFS from start medicine (the one at S). Keep visited set of medicine indices. If we can reach T, print Yes.\n\nComplexities fine.\n\nNote: There could be medicine at S and also other medicines elsewhere. Ensure we map indices.\n\nEdge case: multiple medicines at same cell? Not allowed.\n\nIf S has medicine, we start there after using it, energy = E_s. We could also consider using other medicines after moving.\n\nIf S does not have medicine, answer No.\n\nImplement BFS distances using deque.\n\nReturn Yes/No.\n\nNow produce code with solve() reading stdin, printing result, and call solve().\n\n", "signature": null, "redacted": false}, {"internal": null, "type": "text", "text": "```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve() -> None:\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    it = iter(data)\n    H = int(next(it))\n    W = int(next(it))\n    grid = []\n    S = T = None\n    for i in range(H):\n        row = list(next(it).strip())\n        grid.append(row)\n        for j, ch in enumerate(row):\n            if ch == 'S':\n                S = (i, j)\n            elif ch == 'T':\n                T = (i, j)\n    N = int(next(it))\n    meds = []\n    pos_to_idx = {}\n    for idx in range(N):\n        r = int(next(it)) - 1\n        c = int(next(it)) - 1\n        e = int(next(it))\n        meds.append(((r, c), e))\n        pos_to_idx[(r, c)] = idx\n\n    # Check if there is a medicine at the start\n    if S not in pos_to_idx:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    start_idx = pos_to_idx[S]\n    start_energy = meds[start_idx][1]\n\n    # Precompute distances from each medicine cell\n    # We'll store distances only to other medicine cells and T\n    K = N\n    dist_matrix = [[-1] * K for _ in range(K)]\n    dist_to_T = [-1] * K\n\n    # Directions\n    dirs = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]\n\n    # Helper BFS from a source cell\n    def bfs_from(src):\n        sr, sc = src\n        dgrid = [[-1]*W for _ in range(H)]\n        dq = deque()\n        dgrid[sr][sc] = 0\n        dq.append((sr, sc))\n        while dq:\n            r, c = dq.popleft()\n            nd = dgrid[r][c] + 1\n            for dr, dc in dirs:\n                nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc\n                if 0 <= nr < H and 0 <= nc < W and grid[nr][nc] != '#' and dgrid[nr][nc] == -1:\n                    dgrid[nr][nc] = nd\n                    dq.append((nr, nc))\n        return dgrid\n\n    # Compute BFS for each medicine\n    bfs_results = []\n    for idx in range(K):\n        bfs_results.append(bfs_from(meds[idx][0]))\n\n    # Fill distance matrices\n    for i in range(K):\n        dgrid = bfs_results[i]\n        # distances to other medicines\n        for j in range(K):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            rj, cj = meds[j][0]\n            dist_matrix[i][j] = dgrid[rj][cj]\n        # distance to T\n        tr, tc = T\n        dist_to_T[i] = dgrid[tr][tc]\n\n    # Build graph edges implicitly and BFS over medicines\n    visited = [False]*K\n    q = deque()\n    q.append(start_idx)\n    visited[start_idx] = True\n\n    while q:\n        cur = q.popleft()\n        cur_energy = meds[cur][1]\n        # Can we reach T directly?\n        if dist_to_T[cur] != -1 and dist_to_T[cur] <= cur_energy:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n        # Try to go to other medicines\n        for nxt in range(K):\n            if visited[nxt]:\n                continue\n            d = dist_matrix[cur][nxt]\n            if d != -1 and d <= cur_energy:\n                visited[nxt] = True\n                q.append(nxt)\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "refusal": null}], "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "gpt-oss-120b"}, "stop_reason": "stop", "logprobs": null}], "usage": {"input_tokens": 1129, "output_tokens": 2376, "total_tokens": 3505, "input_tokens_cache_write": null, "input_tokens_cache_read": null, "reasoning_tokens": null}, "time": null, "metadata": null, "error": null}, "messages": [{"id": "20628adc", "content": [{"internal": null, "type": "reasoning", "reasoning": "We need to solve reachability with energy constraints and consumable items that set energy to a specific value (not add).

Input says each cell can have at most one medicine (since positions distinct). So at most one.\n\nThus we can BFS/DFS over medicines: start from S (if medicine there) with its E. Then we can reach any medicine j where dist <= current E. When we reach j, we can then use its medicine (reset to E_j) and continue. Also we can reach T directly if dist <= current E.\n\nThus we need to compute distances between all pairs of relevant cells (medicines + S + T). Grid up to 40000 cells, medicines up to 300, so total nodes up to 302. Compute shortest path distances on grid with obstacles using BFS from each node (O(K * HW) = 300*40000=12M, okay). Use BFS for each node to compute distances to all cells, then extract distances to other nodes.\n\nThen run BFS/DFS on directed graph: from start node (S) if medicine exists else impossible. Use visited set for medicines to avoid loops. Since using a medicine consumes it, you cannot reuse same medicine later (since it's gone). So each medicine can be used at most once. Graph traversal should respect that you cannot revisit a used medicine. But you could pass through a medicine cell without using it earlier, then later use it? That would require you to not have used it before, which is okay. Our graph model assumes you only use medicine when you arrive at its node as a step. If you pass through without using, you could later come back and use it, but that would be a different path. Since we are searching for any path, we can consider using a medicine at first arrival (since using later would waste steps). Might be okay to assume you use it when you first arrive because using later only reduces options. So we can treat each medicine as used when you first reach it.\n\nThus simple BFS over medicines works.\n\nEdge case: there could be medicine at S, but you could also not use it? Starting energy 0, can't move, so must use it.\n\nIf no medicine at S, answer No unless S==T (not possible). So early check.\n\nImplementation steps:\n\n- Read H,W.\n- Read grid lines.\n- Locate S and T.\n- Read N.\n- For i in range(N): read R,C,E. Convert to 0-index.\n- Build list of nodes: each medicine with its position and E. Also include S as a node? Actually S may also have a medicine; we need its E. If S has a medicine, we treat that as start node with its E. If not, impossible.\n- Also need T position (no E).\n- Compute distances from each medicine node (including possibly S) to all cells via BFS. Since we only need distances to other medicine nodes and T, we can stop BFS when all reached, but simpler compute full BFS.\n\n- Build adjacency: for each medicine i, for each medicine j (i!=j), if dist[i][pos_j] <= E_i then edge i->j. Also if dist[i][T] <= E_i then can reach target.\n\n- Perform BFS/DFS from start medicine (the one at S). Keep visited set of medicine indices. If we can reach T, print Yes.\n\nComplexities fine.\n\nNote: There could be medicine at S and also other medicines elsewhere. Ensure we map indices.\n\nEdge case: multiple medicines at same cell? Not allowed.\n\nIf S has medicine, we start there after using it, energy = E_s. We could also consider using other medicines after moving.\n\nIf S does not have medicine, answer No.\n\nImplement BFS distances using deque.\n\nReturn Yes/No.\n\nNow produce code with solve() reading stdin, printing result, and call solve().\n\n", "signature": null, "redacted": false}, {"internal": null, "type": "text", "text": "```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef solve() -> None:\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    it = iter(data)\n    H = int(next(it))\n    W = int(next(it))\n    grid = []\n    S = T = None\n    for i in range(H):\n        row = list(next(it).strip())\n        grid.append(row)\n        for j, ch in enumerate(row):\n            if ch == 'S':\n                S = (i, j)\n            elif ch == 'T':\n                T = (i, j)\n    N = int(next(it))\n    meds = []\n    pos_to_idx = {}\n    for idx in range(N):\n        r = int(next(it)) - 1\n        c = int(next(it)) - 1\n        e = int(next(it))\n        meds.append(((r, c), e))\n        pos_to_idx[(r, c)] = idx\n\n    # Check if there is a medicine at the start\n    if S not in pos_to_idx:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    start_idx = pos_to_idx[S]\n    start_energy = meds[start_idx][1]\n\n    # Precompute distances from each medicine cell\n    # We'll store distances only to other medicine cells and T\n    K = N\n    dist_matrix = [[-1] * K for _ in range(K)]\n    dist_to_T = [-1] * K\n\n    # Directions\n    dirs = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]\n\n    # Helper BFS from a source cell\n    def bfs_from(src):\n        sr, sc = src\n        dgrid = [[-1]*W for _ in range(H)]\n        dq = deque()\n        dgrid[sr][sc] = 0\n        dq.append((sr, sc))\n        while dq:\n            r, c = dq.popleft()\n            nd = dgrid[r][c] + 1\n            for dr, dc in dirs:\n                nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc\n                if 0 <= nr < H and 0 <= nc < W and grid[nr][nc] != '#' and dgrid[nr][nc] == -1:\n                    dgrid[nr][nc] = nd\n                    dq.append((nr, nc))\n        return dgrid\n\n    # Compute BFS for each medicine\n    bfs_results = []\n    for idx in range(K):\n        bfs_results.append(bfs_from(meds[idx][0]))\n\n    # Fill distance matrices\n    for i in range(K):\n        dgrid = bfs_results[i]\n        # distances to other medicines\n        for j in range(K):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            rj, cj = meds[j][0]\n            dist_matrix[i][j] = dgrid[rj][cj]\n        # distance to T\n        tr, tc = T\n        dist_to_T[i] = dgrid[tr][tc]\n\n    # Build graph edges implicitly and BFS over medicines\n    visited = [False]*K\n    q = deque()\n    q.append(start_idx)\n    visited[start_idx] = True\n\n    while q:\n        cur = q.popleft()\n        cur_energy = meds[cur][1]\n        # Can we reach T directly?\n        if dist_to_T[cur] != -1 and dist_to_T[cur] <= cur_energy:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n        # Try to go to other medicines\n        for nxt in range(K):\n            if visited[nxt]:\n                continue\n            d = dist_matrix[cur][nxt]\n            if d != -1 and d <= cur_energy:\n                visited[nxt] = True\n                q.append(nxt)\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "refusal": null}], "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "gpt-oss-120b"}], "metadata": {"task_id": "abc348_d", "question_title": "ยาบนกริด", "test_cases": [{"input": "4 4\nS...\n#..#\n#...\n..#T\n4\n1 1 3\n1 3 5\n3 2 1\n2 3 1\n", "output": "Yes\n", "testtype": "stdin"}, {"input": "2 2\nS.\nT.\n1\n1 2 4\n", "output": "No\n", "testtype": "stdin"}, {"input": "4 5\n..#..\n.S##.\n.##T.\n.....\n3\n3 1 5\n1 2 3\n2 2 1\n", "output": "Yes\n", "testtype": "stdin"}], "public_test_cases": [{"input": "4 4\nS...\n#..#\n#...\n..#T\n4\n1 1 3\n1 3 5\n3 2 1\n2 3 1\n", "output": "Yes\n", "testtype": "stdin"}, {"input": "2 2\nS.\nT.\n1\n1 2 4\n", "output": "No\n", "testtype": "stdin"}, {"input": "4 5\n..#..\n.S##.\n.##T.\n.....\n3\n3 1 5\n1 2 3\n2 2 1\n", "output": "Yes\n", "testtype": "stdin"}], "private_test_cases": [], "difficulty": "hard", "starter_code": "", "requires_stdin": true}}

Initially A is zero array length N, S empty. For each query: toggle x_i in S (if present remove, else add). Then for each j in S, add |S| to A_j. So after each query, we add |S| to each index that is currently in S.\n\nWe need final A after all queries.\n\nConstraints up to 2e5, naive O(N*Q) impossible. Need efficient.\n\nObservation: For each element j, we need to sum over queries where j is in S after processing that query, adding size of S at that moment.\n\nWe can think of timeline of toggles for each element. Each element toggles on/off at certain query times. When it's on, during each subsequent query until it's toggled off, it receives addition of current |S| (size after that query). So contributions depend on global |S| which changes over time.\n\nWe can process queries sequentially, maintaining current size sz = |S|. For each query, after toggling, we have new sz. Then we need to add sz to A_j for all j in S. That's like adding sz to all active elements. This is like we have a set of active indices, and each step we add a value to all of them. We can maintain a global accumulator per element using difference of total added to active set.\n\nWe can maintain an array add[i] that accumulates contributions. When we add sz to all active elements, we can keep a variable total_add that accumulates per-element addition? Actually we need per-element final sum = sum over steps where element active of sz_step.\n\nWe can treat each element's contribution as sum of sz over intervals when it's active. So we need to know for each element the total sum of sz over its active intervals.\n\nWe can process queries, keep current sz, and also maintain a variable cur_total that is cumulative sum of sz over time (prefix sum). Let prefix[t] = sum_{k=1..t} sz_k (where sz_k is size after query k). Then for an element j, if its active intervals are [l1, r1], [l2, r2], ... (inclusive of query indices where after processing query k, j is in S), then its total contribution = sum_{k in intervals} sz_k = prefix[r] - prefix[l-1] for each interval.\n\nThus we can compute for each element the sum of prefix differences over its active intervals. We can process toggles: when element becomes active at query idx t, we record start = t. When it becomes inactive at query idx t, we compute contribution = prefix[t] - prefix[start-1] and add to A[j]. At the end, for elements still active after last query Q, we need contribution from start to Q: prefix[Q] - prefix[start-1].\n\nThus we need to compute prefix array of sz after each query. We can compute sz sequentially, store in list sz_list (size Q). Then compute prefix cumulative sum.\n\nImplementation steps:\n\n- Read N, Q.\n- Read list xs length Q.\n- Initialize sz = 0, sz_list = [].\n- Also maintain a boolean array in_set of size N+1 (1-indexed) to know current membership.\n- For each query i (1-indexed):\n    x = xs[i-1]\n    if in_set[x]:\n        in_set[x] = False\n        sz -= 1\n    else:\n        in_set[x] = True\n        sz += 1\n    sz_list.append(sz)\n\nAfter loop, compute prefix: pref[0]=0; for i in 1..Q: pref[i]=pref[i-1]+sz_list[i-1].\n\nNow we need to compute contributions per element. We'll need to know intervals. We can re-simulate toggles again, but this time we track start times.\n\nInitialize in_set = [False]*(N+1). Also start = [0]*(N+1) maybe store start index when became active. Initialize A = [0]* (N+1). Iterate queries i from 1..Q:\n\n    x = xs[i-1]\n    if in_set[x]:\n        # currently active, will become inactive after this toggle\n        # interval was from start[x] to i-1? Wait careful: The element was active after previous query? Let's define intervals based on after processing each query.\n\nWe defined sz_k as size after processing query k, and active set after processing query k. So when we toggle at query i, the change occurs before we compute sz_i (size after toggle). The element's membership after query i is the new state. So intervals of activity are contiguous ranges of query indices where after processing that query, element is in S.\n\nThus when we toggle off at query i, the element was active after previous query i-1, but after processing query i, it becomes inactive, so its last active query index is i-1. So interval ends at i-1.\n\nSimilarly, when we toggle on at query i, the element becomes active after query i, so its first active index is i.\n\nThus algorithm:\n\n- When we see x and in_set[x] is False (currently inactive before processing query i), we will toggle on: after processing, it becomes active. So we set in_set[x]=True and start[x]=i (the first active query index).\n\n- When we see x and in_set[x] is True (currently active before processing query i), we will toggle off: after processing, it becomes inactive, so its active interval ends at i-1. So we compute contribution = pref[i-1] - pref[start[x]-1] and add to A[x]. Then set in_set[x]=False.\n\nAt the end after processing all queries, for any x still active (in_set[x]=True), its interval goes from start[x] to Q. So contribution = pref[Q] - pref[start[x]-1].\n\nImplementation details: Need pref array length Q+1.\n\nEdge cases: start[x] is set when toggled on.\n\nComplexities O(N+Q).

That later operation\n  overwrites the colour of row `r`, therefore the current row operation\n  does **not** affect `(r,c)`.\n\n* If a column `c` is not `col_done`, no later column operation touches\n  `(r,c)`. The first (in forward time) operation that touches `(r,c)` is\n  exactly the current row operation, so its colour `X` is the final one.\n\nThus every cell `(r,c)` with `col_done[c] = False` receives colour `X`,\nand no other cell does. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nAnalogously, when a column `c` is processed and `col_done[c]` is `False`,\nall cells of column `c` whose row is not yet marked `row_done` will finally\nhave colour `X` of this operation.\n\n*Proof.* Same reasoning as Lemma&nbsp;1, swapping rows and columns. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nAfter the backward scan finishes, the set of rows still not `row_done`\nand the set of columns still not `col_done` are exactly the rows and\ncolumns that were never painted in the forward execution.\n\n*Proof.*  \nA row becomes `row_done` precisely when we encounter the **last**\n(row‑painting) operation that affects it (the first such operation in the\nbackward scan). Hence a row is marked `row_done` iff it appears in at\nleast one row‑painting operation. The same holds for columns. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \n`zero_cells = remaining_rows * remaining_cols` equals the number of cells\nthat keep the initial colour `0`.\n\n*Proof.*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3, the `remaining_rows` rows and `remaining_cols` columns are\nexactly those never painted. Any cell whose row and column are both\nunpainted never receives any colour change, therefore stays `0`. All\nother cells belong to at least one painted row or column and have been\ncounted in Lemma&nbsp;1 or Lemma&nbsp;2. The Cartesian product of the two\nunpainted sets contains `remaining_rows * remaining_cols` cells, all of\ncolour `0`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nFor every colour `c ≠ 0`, the algorithm adds to `cnt[c]` exactly the\nnumber of cells whose final colour is `c`.\n\n*Proof.*  \nConsider a forward‑time operation `op` that finally determines the colour\nof some cells (i.e. it is the last operation touching those cells).

That later operation\n  overwrites the colour of row `r`, therefore the current row operation\n  does **not** affect `(r,c)`.\n\n* If a column `c` is not `col_done`, no later column operation touches\n  `(r,c)`. The first (in forward time) operation that touches `(r,c)` is\n  exactly the current row operation, so its colour `X` is the final one.\n\nThus every cell `(r,c)` with `col_done[c] = False` receives colour `X`,\nand no other cell does. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nAnalogously, when a column `c` is processed and `col_done[c]` is `False`,\nall cells of column `c` whose row is not yet marked `row_done` will finally\nhave colour `X` of this operation.\n\n*Proof.* Same reasoning as Lemma&nbsp;1, swapping rows and columns. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nAfter the backward scan finishes, the set of rows still not `row_done`\nand the set of columns still not `col_done` are exactly the rows and\ncolumns that were never painted in the forward execution.\n\n*Proof.*  \nA row becomes `row_done` precisely when we encounter the **last**\n(row‑painting) operation that affects it (the first such operation in the\nbackward scan). Hence a row is marked `row_done` iff it appears in at\nleast one row‑painting operation. The same holds for columns. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \n`zero_cells = remaining_rows * remaining_cols` equals the number of cells\nthat keep the initial colour `0`.\n\n*Proof.*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3, the `remaining_rows` rows and `remaining_cols` columns are\nexactly those never painted. Any cell whose row and column are both\nunpainted never receives any colour change, therefore stays `0`. All\nother cells belong to at least one painted row or column and have been\ncounted in Lemma&nbsp;1 or Lemma&nbsp;2. The Cartesian product of the two\nunpainted sets contains `remaining_rows * remaining_cols` cells, all of\ncolour `0`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nFor every colour `c ≠ 0`, the algorithm adds to `cnt[c]` exactly the\nnumber of cells whose final colour is `c`.\n\n*Proof.*  \nConsider a forward‑time operation `op` that finally determines the colour\nof some cells (i.e. it is the last operation touching those cells). In the\nbackward scan `op` is the first encountered operation that touches the\ncorresponding row or column, because all later (original) operations have\nalready been processed and marked the involved rows/columns as done.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 or Lemma&nbsp;2 the algorithm adds precisely the number of\nstill‑undone columns (or rows) to `cnt[ colour_of_op ]`, which equals the\nnumber of cells for which `op` is the last affecting operation.\nNo other step adds to `cnt[ colour_of_op ]` for those cells, because after\n`op` the row/column becomes marked done. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nAfter termination, for every colour `c` (including `0`) `cnt[c]` equals\nthe number of cells coloured `c` in the final grid. Consequently the\noutput of the algorithm is correct.\n\n*Proof.*  \nFor `c = 0` the claim follows from Lemma&nbsp;4.  \nFor `c ≠ 0` it follows from Lemma&nbsp;5.  \nAll cells belong to exactly one colour, therefore the multiset of counts\nis complete.

Need to output indices of remaining cards sorted ascending.\n\nWe need to compute which cards survive after repeatedly removing any card that is dominated by another card with higher strength but lower cost. This is similar to finding cards that are not \"dominated\" in the sense that there exists another card with both higher A and lower C. The process of repeatedly removing y when such a pair exists leads to removing all cards that are not part of the \"Pareto frontier\" when sorting by A ascending and C descending? Let's think.\n\nDefine relation: card i is \"bad\" if there exists j with A_j > A_i and C_j < C_i. Then i can be removed (choose x=j, y=i). After removal, other cards may become removable? But if i is bad, it can be removed regardless of others. Removing some cards doesn't create new badness for remaining ones because condition depends only on existence of a higher A lower C card. If such a card is removed, maybe i becomes not bad. But note that we only remove y (the weaker one). The stronger higher A lower C card is never removed because it can't be y in that pair (since its C is lower).

So ultimately, the survivors are those that are maximal in the partial order where higher A and lower C is better. This is exactly the set of cards that are not dominated by any other card in both dimensions (strength higher, cost lower). That's the set of Pareto-optimal points when we consider A as increasing, C as decreasing (i.e., we want points that are not strictly worse in both dimensions). Since A and C are distinct, we can sort by A descending, and keep track of minimal C seen so far. A card is kept if its C is less than the minimum C among cards with higher A (i.e., earlier in descending A).

After flips, we get string T. T is \"good\" if there is exactly one integer i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ N-1 and T[i] == T[i+1] (using 1-indexed). So exactly one adjacent equal pair. All other adjacent pairs must be different. So T must be alternating except for exactly one place where two same bits appear consecutively.\n\nGoal: minimal total cost to achieve a good string.\n\nWe can decide which positions to flip. Equivalent to choose final T that is good, and cost is sum of C_i for positions where T_i != S_i.\n\nWe need minimal cost over all good T.\n\nWe need to compute efficiently O(N). N up to 2e5.\n\nLet's think about structure of good strings.\n\nLet’s denote bits as 0/1. For a string of length N, with exactly one adjacent equal pair. That means the string consists of alternating pattern, but at some position i (1 ≤ i ≤ N-1) we have a double same bits, causing a \"break\". After that, the pattern may continue alternating? Let's examine.\n\nIf we have alternating bits, pattern is either starting with 0 or 1. If we introduce a double same at position i (i,i+1 same), then the rest after i+1 must continue alternating? Let's test: Suppose we have bits ... a_i, a_{i+1}=a_i, then a_{i+2} must be different from a_{i+1} to avoid another equal pair. So a_{i+2}=!a_i. Then a_{i+3}=a_i, etc. So after the double, the alternating continues but shifted. So overall string is determined by starting bit and the position of the double.\n\nThus any good string can be described by: choose start bit s0 (0 or 1), choose position i where double occurs (1..N-1). Then define T[1]=s0, and for j>1, T[j] = if j <= i then alternating from start (i.e., T[j] = s0 xor (j-1)%2), but at i+1 we set same as i, breaking alternation. Actually we need to define rule: For j <= i, T[j] = s0 xor (j-1)%2 (alternating). For j = i+1, we set T[i+1] = T[i] (same). For j > i+1, we continue alternating from there: T[j] = T[i+1] xor (j-(i+1))%2 = T[i] xor (j-(i+1))%2.\n\nLet's test: Example N=5, start 1, double at i=2. Then T1=1, T2=0 (alternating), T3 same as T2=0, T4 = 1, T5=0. Adjacent equal only at (2,3). Works.\n\nThus there are 2*N-2 possible good strings? Actually i from 1..N-1 (N-1 choices) and start bit 0/1 => 2*(N-1). That's up to 4e5, manageable to evaluate cost for each? O(N^2) not.\n\nWe need compute minimal cost efficiently.\n\nWe can precompute prefix costs for matching alternating pattern starting with 0 or 1.\n\nDefine arrays:\n\ncost0[j] = cost to make prefix up to j follow alternating pattern starting with 0 (i.e., expected bit = (j-1)%2). So cost0[j] = sum_{k=1..j} (S[k]!=expected0[k]) * C_k.\n\nSimilarly cost1[j] for starting with 1 (expected = 1 xor (k-1)%2).\n\nWe can compute prefix sums.\n\nNow for a given start bit s0 and double position i, total cost = cost to match alternating up to i (including i) + cost to set position i+1 same as i (maybe need to flip if S[i+1] not equal to expected same) + cost for suffix after i+1 following alternating starting from that same bit.\n\nBut note that after i+1, the expected pattern is alternating starting with bit = T[i+1] (which equals T[i]). So the suffix pattern is same as alternating pattern starting with bit = T[i] (i.e., same as start bit if i is odd? Let's compute.\n\nIf start s0, then T[i] = s0 xor (i-1)%2 (alternating). Then T[i+1] = same = T[i]. For j > i+1, expected = T[i+1] xor (j-(i+1))%2 = T[i] xor (j-(i+1))%2.\n\nThus the suffix pattern is alternating with start bit = T[i] at position i+1 (index offset 0). So we can compute cost for suffix using precomputed arrays but need to align.\n\nWe can precompute suffix costs for alternating patterns starting with 0 or 1 as well.\n\nDefine suffix0[j] = cost to make substring j..N follow alternating pattern starting with 0 at position j (i.e., expected at position j is 0, then alternates). Similarly suffix1[j].\n\nWe can compute suffix arrays from right to left.\n\nNow for given start s0 and double i, total cost = prefix cost up to i (alternating with start s0) + cost to set position i+1 to same as T[i] (i.e., if S[i+1] != T[i], add C_{i+1}) + suffix cost for positions i+2..N following alternating starting with opposite of T[i] (since at i+2 expected = opposite of T[i]).\n\nWait: At i+2, expected = opposite of T[i] (since alternates). So suffix pattern starting at i+2 with start bit = opposite of T[i].\n\nThus we need suffix cost from i+2 with start bit = opposite of T[i].\n\nEdge cases: if i+1 = N, then suffix empty cost 0.\n\nSimilarly if i = 0? Not allowed.\n\nThus we can compute total cost efficiently O(1) per i per start s0.\n\nWe need to compute T[i] = s0 xor ((i-1)%2). Let parity = (i-1)%2.\n\nLet bit_i = s0 ^ parity.\n\nThen cost_prefix = prefix_alternating_cost(s0, i) = if s0==0 then cost0[i] else cost1[i].\n\nCost_flip_i1 = (S[i+1] != bit_i) * C_{i+1}.\n\nNow suffix start bit = bit_i ^ 1 (opposite). Need suffix cost from position i+2 with start bit = bit_i ^ 1.\n\nDefine suffixCost(startBit, pos) = cost to make substring pos..N alternating starting with startBit at pos.\n\nWe can precompute suffix0[pos] and suffix1[pos].\n\nThus suffix_cost = if (bit_i ^ 1) == 0 then suffix0[i+2] else suffix1[i+2].\n\nIf i+2 > N, suffix cost = 0.\n\nTotal = cost_prefix + cost_flip_i1 + suffix_cost.\n\nWe need minimal over s0 in {0,1} and i in 1..N-1.\n\nComplexities O(N).\n\nImplementation details:\n\nRead N, S, list C (N ints). Note input format: first line N, second line S, third line C1..CN maybe on same line. Example shows N on line, S on line, then costs line.\n\nEdge Cases: N up to 2e5, costs up to 1e9, sum may exceed 32-bit, use Python int.\n\nCompute arrays of length N+2 for convenience (1-indexed). We'll store S as list of ints bits.\n\nCompute prefix0[0]=0, prefix1[0]=0.\n\nFor i from 1..N:\n expected0 = (i-1)%2  # 0 if i odd, 1 if i even\n expected1 = 1 ^ ((i-1)%2)  # start with 1\n cost0[i] = cost0[i-1] + (S[i]!=expected0)*C[i]\n cost1[i] = cost1[i-1] + (S[i]!=expected1)*C[i]\n\nSimilarly suffix arrays: suffix0[N+1]=0, suffix1[N+1]=0.\n\nFor i from N down to 1:\n expected0 = 0 if (i%2==1?) Wait need to define expected at position i when starting with 0 at i. So expected0 = 0 if (i - i) %2 =0 => always 0 at start. But as we move left, the parity changes. Actually suffix pattern defined as starting at position i with startBit b, then expected at i is b, at i+1 is b^1, etc. So when computing suffix arrays iteratively from right, we need to know expected at i based on startBit.\n\nWe can compute suffix0[i] = suffix0[i+1] + (S[i]!=0)*C[i] if we assume startBit=0 at i, but then at i+1 the startBit would be 1 for suffix0[i+1]? Wait suffix0[i+1] is cost for substring i+1..N starting with 0 at i+1, not 1. So we cannot directly use suffix0[i+1].\n\nThus better compute suffix arrays using parity relative to position.\n\nAlternative: we can compute suffix cost for each startBit using formula similar to prefix but reversed: define suffix0[i] = cost to make substring i..N alternating with startBit 0 at i. Then recurrence: suffix0[i] = (S[i]!=0)*C[i] + suffix1[i+1] because at i+1 the startBit flips to 1. Similarly suffix1[i] = (S[i]!=1)*C[i] + suffix0[i+1].\n\nThus we can compute from N down to 1.\n\nInitialize suffix0[N+1]=suffix1[N+1]=0.\n\nFor i=N down to 1:\n suffix0[i] = (S[i]!=0)*C[i] + suffix1[i+1]\n suffix1[i] = (S[i]!=1)*C[i] + suffix0[i+1]\n\nWorks.\n\nNow we can query suffix cost from position p with startBit b: if b==0 then suffix0[p] else suffix1[p].\n\nNow compute answer:\n\nans = INF large.\n\nFor s0 in (0,1):\n for i in 1..N-1:\n   bit_i = s0 ^ ((i-1)&1)\n   prefix = cost0[i] if s0==0 else cost1[i]\n   flipcost = (S[i+1]!=bit_i) * C[i+1]\n   startBit_suffix = bit_i ^ 1\n   if i+2 <= N:\n        suffix = suffix0[i+2] if startBit_suffix==0 else suffix1[i+2]\n   else:\n        suffix = 0\n   total = prefix + flipcost + suffix\n   ans = min(ans,total)\n\nComplexities O(N*2) = O(N).\n\nEdge Cases: N=2 minimal.

Let parity = (i-1)%2.\n\nLet bit_i = s0 ^ parity.\n\nThen cost_prefix = prefix_alternating_cost(s0, i) = if s0==0 then cost0[i] else cost1[i].\n\nCost_flip_i1 = (S[i+1] != bit_i) * C_{i+1}.\n\nNow suffix start bit = bit_i ^ 1 (opposite). Need suffix cost from position i+2 with start bit = bit_i ^ 1.\n\nDefine suffixCost(startBit, pos) = cost to make substring pos..N alternating starting with startBit at pos.\n\nWe can precompute suffix0[pos] and suffix1[pos].\n\nThus suffix_cost = if (bit_i ^ 1) == 0 then suffix0[i+2] else suffix1[i+2].\n\nIf i+2 > N, suffix cost = 0.\n\nTotal = cost_prefix + cost_flip_i1 + suffix_cost.\n\nWe need minimal over s0 in {0,1} and i in 1..N-1.\n\nComplexities O(N).\n\nImplementation details:\n\nRead N, S, list C (N ints). Note input format: first line N, second line S, third line C1..CN maybe on same line. Example shows N on line, S on line, then costs line.\n\nEdge Cases: N up to 2e5, costs up to 1e9, sum may exceed 32-bit, use Python int.\n\nCompute arrays of length N+2 for convenience (1-indexed). We'll store S as list of ints bits.\n\nCompute prefix0[0]=0, prefix1[0]=0.\n\nFor i from 1..N:\n expected0 = (i-1)%2  # 0 if i odd, 1 if i even\n expected1 = 1 ^ ((i-1)%2)  # start with 1\n cost0[i] = cost0[i-1] + (S[i]!=expected0)*C[i]\n cost1[i] = cost1[i-1] + (S[i]!=expected1)*C[i]\n\nSimilarly suffix arrays: suffix0[N+1]=0, suffix1[N+1]=0.\n\nFor i from N down to 1:\n expected0 = 0 if (i%2==1?) Wait need to define expected at position i when starting with 0 at i. So expected0 = 0 if (i - i) %2 =0 => always 0 at start. But as we move left, the parity changes. Actually suffix pattern defined as starting at position i with startBit b, then expected at i is b, at i+1 is b^1, etc. So when computing suffix arrays iteratively from right, we need to know expected at i based on startBit.\n\nWe can compute suffix0[i] = suffix0[i+1] + (S[i]!=0)*C[i] if we assume startBit=0 at i, but then at i+1 the startBit would be 1 for suffix0[i+1]? Wait suffix0[i+1] is cost for substring i+1..N starting with 0 at i+1, not 1. So we cannot directly use suffix0[i+1].\n\nThus better compute suffix arrays using parity relative to position.\n\nAlternative: we can compute suffix cost for each startBit using formula similar to prefix but reversed: define suffix0[i] = cost to make substring i..N alternating with startBit 0 at i. Then recurrence: suffix0[i] = (S[i]!=0)*C[i] + suffix1[i+1] because at i+1 the startBit flips to 1. Similarly suffix1[i] = (S[i]!=1)*C[i] + suffix0[i+1].\n\nThus we can compute from N down to 1.\n\nInitialize suffix0[N+1]=suffix1[N+1]=0.\n\nFor i=N down to 1:\n suffix0[i] = (S[i]!=0)*C[i] + suffix1[i+1]\n suffix1[i] = (S[i]!=1)*C[i] + suffix0[i+1]\n\nWorks.\n\nNow we can query suffix cost from position p with startBit b: if b==0 then suffix0[p] else suffix1[p].\n\nNow compute answer:\n\nans = INF large.\n\nFor s0 in (0,1):\n for i in 1..N-1:\n   bit_i = s0 ^ ((i-1)&1)\n   prefix = cost0[i] if s0==0 else cost1[i]\n   flipcost = (S[i+1]!=bit_i) * C[i+1]\n   startBit_suffix = bit_i ^ 1\n   if i+2 <= N:\n        suffix = suffix0[i+2] if startBit_suffix==0 else suffix1[i+2]\n   else:\n        suffix = 0\n   total = prefix + flipcost + suffix\n   ans = min(ans,total)\n\nComplexities O(N*2) = O(N).\n\nEdge Cases: N=2 minimal. Then i only 1.

Actually need to find longest substring where each character appears at most 2 times within that substring. For \"bcbbbcba\", let's test: The whole string has b appears 4 times, c appears 2, a appears 1. b appears >2, so invalid. Need longest substring where each char count <=2. Let's find: maybe \"bcbb\" length 4 (b appears 3? Actually \"bcbb\": b appears 3, invalid). \"cbbb\": b appears 3. \"bbbc\": b appears 3. \"bbcb\": b appears 3. \"bbca\": b appears 2, c 1, a1 => length 4 valid. So answer 4. Good.\n\nSecond example \"aaaa\": longest substring where each char appears at most 2 times is \"aa\" length 2.\n\nConstraints length up to 100, simple sliding window with counts, maintain window where any count >2, shrink left.\n\nReturn max length.\n\nImplement function: def max_substring_len_at_most_two(s): ...\n\nReturn int.\n\nProvide only code block with function definition.\n\nLet's produce final answer.", "signature": null, "redacted": false}, {"internal": null, "type": "text", "text": "```python\ndef max_substring_len_at_most_two(s: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the maximum length of a substring of `s` such that each character\n    appears at most twice within that substring.\n    \"\"\"\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    left = 0\n    max_len = 0\n    cnt = defaultdict(int)\n\n    for right, ch in enumerate(s):\n        cnt[ch] += 1\n        # If any character exceeds 2, move left pointer to restore validity\n        while cnt[ch] > 2:\n            cnt[s[left]] -= 1\n            left += 1\n        # Update maximum length\n        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)\n\n    return max_len\n```", "refusal": null}], "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "gpt-oss-120b"}], "metadata": {"task_id": "3349", "question_title": "ซับสตริงความยาวสูงสุดที่มีการเกิดสองครั้ง", "test_cases": [{"input": "\"bcbbbcba\"", "output": "4", "testtype": "functional"}, {"input": "\"aaaa\"", "output": "2", "testtype": "functional"}], "public_test_cases": [{"input": "\"bcbbbcba\"", "output": "4", "testtype": "functional"}, {"input": "\"aaaa\"", "output": "2", "testtype": "functional"}], "private_test_cases": [], "difficulty": "easy", "starter_code": "class Solution:\n    def maximumLengthSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:\n        ", "requires_stdin": false}}

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm prints the winner of the game when both players\nplay optimally.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any board state `(red_mask, taken_mask)` the function `solve_state`\nreturns `+1` iff Takahashi has a forced win from that state, assuming optimal\nplay from both sides; otherwise it returns `-1`.\n\n**Proof.** By induction on the number of empty cells.\n\n*Base.* No empty cells (`taken_mask == ALL`).  \nThe game ends, the winner is the player with larger total score.\n`solve_state` computes the score difference and returns `+1` exactly when\n`T > A`. Hence the lemma holds.\n\n*Induction step.* Assume the lemma true for all states with fewer empty cells\nthan the current state `S`.  \nLet `turn` be the player to move in `S`.\n\nConsider any legal move `m` from `S` leading to state `S'`.\n\n* If the move creates a line of the mover’s colour, the mover wins\nimmediately. `solve_state` returns the corresponding outcome (`+1` for\nTakahashi, `-1` for Aoki). This is correct because the game ends right there.\n\n* Otherwise the game continues from `S'`. By the induction hypothesis,\n`solve_state(S')` correctly tells which player has a forced win from `S'`.\n\nNow `solve_state` selects the *best* outcome among all moves:\n* Takahashi (maximiser) keeps the maximal value,\n* Aoki (minimiser) keeps the minimal value.\n\nIf there exists a move that makes the mover win (`+1` for Takahashi,\n`-1` for Aoki) the algorithm will pick it, otherwise it will pick the\nbest among the opponent‑winning possibilities. This exactly matches the\ndefinition of a forced win under optimal play.\n\nThus `solve_state(S)` returns `+1` iff Takahashi can force a win from `S`,\notherwise `-1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nThe initial call `solve_state(0,0)` returns `+1` iff Takahashi wins the\noriginal game with optimal play.\n\n**Proof.** The empty board corresponds to the start of the game, and it is\nTakahashi’s turn (zero taken cells). By Lemma&nbsp;1 the function’s return\nvalue characterises the existence of a forced win for Takahashi from exactly\nthis position. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe program prints `\"Takahashi\"` exactly when Takahashi wins the game under\noptimal play; otherwise it prints `\"Aoki\"`.\n\n**Proof.** The program computes `result = solve_state(0,0)`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2, `result = +1` ⇔ Takahashi has a forced win, `result = -1`\n⇔ Aoki has a forced win. The final `print` statement maps these two cases\nto the required strings, therefore the output is correct. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.   Complexity Analysis  \n\n*Number of states* ≤ `3⁹ = 19683`.  \nFor each state we examine at most 9 moves and test 8 winning masks (constant).\n\n```\nTime   : O( number_of_states × 9 × 8 )  ≤ 1.5·10⁶ operations\nMemory : O( number_of_states )          ≤ 2·10⁴ entries\n```\n\nBoth are negligible.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm prints the winner of the game when both players\nplay optimally.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any board state `(red_mask, taken_mask)` the function `solve_state`\nreturns `+1` iff Takahashi has a forced win from that state, assuming optimal\nplay from both sides; otherwise it returns `-1`.\n\n**Proof.** By induction on the number of empty cells.\n\n*Base.* No empty cells (`taken_mask == ALL`).  \nThe game ends, the winner is the player with larger total score.\n`solve_state` computes the score difference and returns `+1` exactly when\n`T > A`. Hence the lemma holds.\n\n*Induction step.* Assume the lemma true for all states with fewer empty cells\nthan the current state `S`.  \nLet `turn` be the player to move in `S`.\n\nConsider any legal move `m` from `S` leading to state `S'`.\n\n* If the move creates a line of the mover’s colour, the mover wins\nimmediately. `solve_state` returns the corresponding outcome (`+1` for\nTakahashi, `-1` for Aoki). This is correct because the game ends right there.\n\n* Otherwise the game continues from `S'`. By the induction hypothesis,\n`solve_state(S')` correctly tells which player has a forced win from `S'`.\n\nNow `solve_state` selects the *best* outcome among all moves:\n* Takahashi (maximiser) keeps the maximal value,\n* Aoki (minimiser) keeps the minimal value.\n\nIf there exists a move that makes the mover win (`+1` for Takahashi,\n`-1` for Aoki) the algorithm will pick it, otherwise it will pick the\nbest among the opponent‑winning possibilities. This exactly matches the\ndefinition of a forced win under optimal play.\n\nThus `solve_state(S)` returns `+1` iff Takahashi can force a win from `S`,\notherwise `-1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nThe initial call `solve_state(0,0)` returns `+1` iff Takahashi wins the\noriginal game with optimal play.\n\n**Proof.** The empty board corresponds to the start of the game, and it is\nTakahashi’s turn (zero taken cells). By Lemma&nbsp;1 the function’s return\nvalue characterises the existence of a forced win for Takahashi from exactly\nthis position. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe program prints `\"Takahashi\"` exactly when Takahashi wins the game under\noptimal play; otherwise it prints `\"Aoki\"`.\n\n**Proof.** The program computes `result = solve_state(0,0)`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2, `result = +1` ⇔ Takahashi has a forced win, `result = -1`\n⇔ Aoki has a forced win. The final `print` statement maps these two cases\nto the required strings, therefore the output is correct. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Rabbit moves from (x,y) to (x+1,y+1), (x+1,y-1), (x-1,y+1), (x-1,y-1). That's like moving diagonally on chessboard (like bishop moves but only one step each move). So each move changes both x and y by +/-1. So parity of x+y changes? Let's see: (x+y) after move: (x+1)+(y+1)=x+y+2, (x+1)+(y-1)=x+y, (x-1)+(y+1)=x+y, (x-1)+(y-1)=x+y-2. So parity of x+y stays same (since change by even). Also parity of x-y? (x+1)-(y+1)=x-y, (x+1)-(y-1)=x-y+2, (x-1)-(y+1)=x-y-2, (x-1)-(y-1)=x-y. So parity of x-y also stays same. Actually both x+y and x-y parity remain unchanged (they stay same parity). So reachable condition: Two points are reachable iff (x1+y1) % 2 == (x2+y2) % 2 (i.e., same parity). Also maybe also same parity of x and y individually? Let's think: Starting from (x,y), after k moves, x changes by sum of +/-1 each move, so x parity flips each move? Actually each move changes x by +/-1, so parity of x flips each move. Similarly y parity flips each move. After k moves, parity of x = original parity xor (k%2). Same for y. So after k moves, parity of x+y = (x parity xor k) + (y parity xor k) mod2 = (x+y parity) xor (k xor k)?? Let's compute: parity of sum = (x parity + y parity) mod2. After k moves, x parity = x0 xor (k mod2), y parity = y0 xor (k mod2). Sum parity = (x0 xor k) + (y0 xor k) mod2 = (x0 + y0 + 2k) mod2 = (x0+y0) mod2. So indeed parity of x+y invariant. Similarly x-y parity = (x0 xor k) - (y0 xor k) mod2 = (x0 - y0) mod2. So reachable iff parity of x+y same (or equivalently parity of x and y both same? Actually if x+y parity same, then also x-y parity same automatically? Let's check: If (x1+y1) %2 = (x2+y2)%2, then (x1-y1)%2 = (x1+y1 -2y1)%2 = (x1+y1)%2 - (2y1)%2 = same parity. So both invariants same condition). So reachable condition is parity of (x+y) same.\n\nIf reachable, what's minimum number of moves? This is like moving on a grid with diagonal steps. Equivalent to Chebyshev distance? Actually each move changes both coordinates by +/-1, so after k moves, x changes by some integer dx where |dx| <= k and parity of dx = k mod2 (since each step changes x by +/-1). Similarly dy same parity. Also dx and dy have same parity as k (since each step changes both). Also after k moves, we have dx+dy even? Let's think: Since each move changes x and y by +/-1, the sum of absolute changes? Actually we can think of moving like on rotated grid: define u = x+y, v = x-y. Then a move (±1,±1) changes u by either +2,0,-2 and v by either 0,±2. Specifically moves: (1,1): u+2, v unchanged. (1,-1): u unchanged, v+2. (-1,1): u unchanged, v-2. (-1,-1): u-2, v unchanged. So each move changes either u by ±2 or v by ±2, not both. So it's like you can move along u or v axis by steps of 2. So to go from (u1,v1) to (u2,v2), you need |u2-u1|/2 + |v2-v1|/2 moves (since each move changes one coordinate by 2). So distance = (|Δu| + |Δv|)/2. Since u = x+y, v = x-y. So Δu = (x2+y2)-(x1+y1), Δv = (x2 - y2)-(x1 - y1) = (x2 - x1) - (y2 - y1). So distance = (| (x2+y2)-(x1+y1) | + | (x2 - y2)-(x1 - y1) |) / 2.\n\nBut need to ensure reachable: parity condition ensures Δu and Δv are even, so division yields integer.\n\nThus dist(A,B) = (abs(dx+dy) + abs(dx-dy)) / 2 where dx = x2 - x1, dy = y2 - y1. Simplify: This equals max(|dx|,|dy|)? Let's test: Suppose dx=3, dy=1. Then abs(dx+dy)=4, abs(dx-dy)=2, sum=6, /2=3. max(|dx|,|dy|)=3. Another: dx=2, dy=2 => sum abs(4)+abs(0)=4 => /2=2, max=2. dx=2, dy=0 => abs(2)+abs(2)=4/2=2, max=2. Indeed formula equals max(|dx|,|dy|). Because max = (|dx+dy|+|dx-dy|)/2. That's known identity. So distance = max(|dx|,|dy|) if parity condition satisfied, else 0.\n\nThus we need sum over all pairs of max(|dx|,|dy|) for pairs where (x+y) parity same. N up to 2e5, coordinates up to 1e8.\n\nWe need efficient O(N log N). We can separate points into two groups based on parity of (x+y) %2. Within each group, sum of max(|dx|,|dy|) over all pairs.\n\nWe need to compute sum_{i<j} max(|xi - xj|, |yi - yj|). This is similar to L-infinity distance sum. Compute sum of L∞ distances.\n\nWe can compute sum of max(|dx|,|dy|) = sum over pairs of L∞ distance.\n\nWe need efficient method. Known technique: sort by x and y? Not straightforward because max.\n\nObservation: max(|dx|,|dy|) = (|dx| + |dy| + | |dx| - |dy| |)/2? Actually max = (|dx|+|dy|+| |dx|-|dy| |)/2. But maybe we can compute sum of max = sum of |dx| + sum of (max - |dx|). Not easy.\n\nAlternative: Transform coordinates: rotate 45 degrees? L∞ distance in original axes equals L1 distance in rotated coordinates scaled by 1/2? Actually define u = x + y, v = x - y. Then max(|dx|,|dy|) = (|Δu| + |Δv|)/2 (as earlier). So sum of max = 0.5 * sum_{pairs} (|Δu| + |Δv|) = 0.5 * (sum_{pairs} |Δu| + sum_{pairs} |Δv|). Since u and v are integers (maybe even). So we can compute sum of absolute differences for u and v separately, then add and divide by 2.\n\nThus problem reduces to: For each parity group, compute sum_{i<j} |ui - uj| and sum_{i<j} |vi - vj|. Then answer = (sumU + sumV)//2 (since result integer). Because parity ensures both differences even, sumU+sumV even.\n\nNow computing sum of absolute differences for a list of numbers can be done by sorting and using prefix sums: sum_{i} a_i * (2i - n +1) after sorting.\n\nSo algorithm:\n\n- Read N.\n- For each point, compute parity = (x+y) & 1.\n- Append u = x + y, v = x - y to list for that parity.\n- For each parity group (0 and 1):\n   - If size m <=1 continue.\n   - Sort u list, compute sumU = sum_{i} u[i] * i - prefix before? Actually formula: after sorting ascending, sum_{i} (u[i] * i - prefix_sum_before_i). This yields sum of differences where u[i] is larger element. So total sum = sum_{i} (u[i] * i - prefix_sum[i-1]).\n   - Similarly for v.\n   - Add to total sumU+sumV.\n- Finally answer = (total_sumU + total_sumV)//2.\n- Print answer.\n\nComplexities O(N log N). Use Python int (big). Ensure using long.\n\nEdge Cases: v = x - y can be negative, sorting works.\n\nTest with sample1: points (0,0): parity 0, u=0, v=0. (1,3): parity (1+3)=4 even =>0, u=4, v=-2. (5,6): parity 11 odd =>1, u=11, v=-1. Group0: u=[0,4], v=[0,-2]. sumU = |4-0|=4. sumV = |0-(-2)|=2. total =6, answer=3. matches.\n\nSample2: points: (0,5) parity 5 odd =>1, u=5, v=-5.

Group0: points (1,7) u8 v-6; (4,6) u10 v-2. sumU=2, sumV=4 => total6 => answer3? Wait compute: sumU=|10-8|=2, sumV=|-2-(-6)|=4, total=6, half=3. Group1: points (0,5) u5 v-5; (2,9) u11 v-7; (3,8) u11 v-5. Compute sumU: sorted u [5,11,11]; differences: (11-5)+(11-5)+(11-11)=6+6+0=12. sumV: sorted v [-7,-5,-5]; differences: (-5-(-7)) + (-5-(-7)) + (-5-(-5)) =2+2+0=4. total=16, half=8.

So each move changes both x and y by +/-1. So parity of x+y changes? Let's see: (x+y) after move: (x+1)+(y+1)=x+y+2, (x+1)+(y-1)=x+y, (x-1)+(y+1)=x+y, (x-1)+(y-1)=x+y-2. So parity of x+y stays same (since change by even). Also parity of x-y? (x+1)-(y+1)=x-y, (x+1)-(y-1)=x-y+2, (x-1)-(y+1)=x-y-2, (x-1)-(y-1)=x-y. So parity of x-y also stays same. Actually both x+y and x-y parity remain unchanged (they stay same parity). So reachable condition: Two points are reachable iff (x1+y1) % 2 == (x2+y2) % 2 (i.e., same parity). Also maybe also same parity of x and y individually? Let's think: Starting from (x,y), after k moves, x changes by sum of +/-1 each move, so x parity flips each move? Actually each move changes x by +/-1, so parity of x flips each move. Similarly y parity flips each move. After k moves, parity of x = original parity xor (k%2). Same for y. So after k moves, parity of x+y = (x parity xor k) + (y parity xor k) mod2 = (x+y parity) xor (k xor k)?? Let's compute: parity of sum = (x parity + y parity) mod2. After k moves, x parity = x0 xor (k mod2), y parity = y0 xor (k mod2). Sum parity = (x0 xor k) + (y0 xor k) mod2 = (x0 + y0 + 2k) mod2 = (x0+y0) mod2. So indeed parity of x+y invariant. Similarly x-y parity = (x0 xor k) - (y0 xor k) mod2 = (x0 - y0) mod2. So reachable iff parity of x+y same (or equivalently parity of x and y both same? Actually if x+y parity same, then also x-y parity same automatically? Let's check: If (x1+y1) %2 = (x2+y2)%2, then (x1-y1)%2 = (x1+y1 -2y1)%2 = (x1+y1)%2 - (2y1)%2 = same parity. So both invariants same condition). So reachable condition is parity of (x+y) same.\n\nIf reachable, what's minimum number of moves? This is like moving on a grid with diagonal steps. Equivalent to Chebyshev distance? Actually each move changes both coordinates by +/-1, so after k moves, x changes by some integer dx where |dx| <= k and parity of dx = k mod2 (since each step changes x by +/-1). Similarly dy same parity. Also dx and dy have same parity as k (since each step changes both). Also after k moves, we have dx+dy even? Let's think: Since each move changes x and y by +/-1, the sum of absolute changes? Actually we can think of moving like on rotated grid: define u = x+y, v = x-y. Then a move (±1,±1) changes u by either +2,0,-2 and v by either 0,±2. Specifically moves: (1,1): u+2, v unchanged. (1,-1): u unchanged, v+2. (-1,1): u unchanged, v-2. (-1,-1): u-2, v unchanged. So each move changes either u by ±2 or v by ±2, not both. So it's like you can move along u or v axis by steps of 2. So to go from (u1,v1) to (u2,v2), you need |u2-u1|/2 + |v2-v1|/2 moves (since each move changes one coordinate by 2). So distance = (|Δu| + |Δv|)/2. Since u = x+y, v = x-y. So Δu = (x2+y2)-(x1+y1), Δv = (x2 - y2)-(x1 - y1) = (x2 - x1) - (y2 - y1). So distance = (| (x2+y2)-(x1+y1) | + | (x2 - y2)-(x1 - y1) |) / 2.\n\nBut need to ensure reachable: parity condition ensures Δu and Δv are even, so division yields integer.\n\nThus dist(A,B) = (abs(dx+dy) + abs(dx-dy)) / 2 where dx = x2 - x1, dy = y2 - y1. Simplify: This equals max(|dx|,|dy|)? Let's test: Suppose dx=3, dy=1. Then abs(dx+dy)=4, abs(dx-dy)=2, sum=6, /2=3. max(|dx|,|dy|)=3. Another: dx=2, dy=2 => sum abs(4)+abs(0)=4 => /2=2, max=2. dx=2, dy=0 => abs(2)+abs(2)=4/2=2, max=2. Indeed formula equals max(|dx|,|dy|). Because max = (|dx+dy|+|dx-dy|)/2. That's known identity. So distance = max(|dx|,|dy|) if parity condition satisfied, else 0.\n\nThus we need sum over all pairs of max(|dx|,|dy|) for pairs where (x+y) parity same. N up to 2e5, coordinates up to 1e8.\n\nWe need efficient O(N log N). We can separate points into two groups based on parity of (x+y) %2. Within each group, sum of max(|dx|,|dy|) over all pairs.\n\nWe need to compute sum_{i<j} max(|xi - xj|, |yi - yj|). This is similar to L-infinity distance sum. Compute sum of L∞ distances.\n\nWe can compute sum of max(|dx|,|dy|) = sum over pairs of L∞ distance.\n\nWe need efficient method. Known technique: sort by x and y? Not straightforward because max.\n\nObservation: max(|dx|,|dy|) = (|dx| + |dy| + | |dx| - |dy| |)/2? Actually max = (|dx|+|dy|+| |dx|-|dy| |)/2. But maybe we can compute sum of max = sum of |dx| + sum of (max - |dx|). Not easy.\n\nAlternative: Transform coordinates: rotate 45 degrees? L∞ distance in original axes equals L1 distance in rotated coordinates scaled by 1/2? Actually define u = x + y, v = x - y. Then max(|dx|,|dy|) = (|Δu| + |Δv|)/2 (as earlier). So sum of max = 0.5 * sum_{pairs} (|Δu| + |Δv|) = 0.5 * (sum_{pairs} |Δu| + sum_{pairs} |Δv|). Since u and v are integers (maybe even). So we can compute sum of absolute differences for u and v separately, then add and divide by 2.\n\nThus problem reduces to: For each parity group, compute sum_{i<j} |ui - uj| and sum_{i<j} |vi - vj|. Then answer = (sumU + sumV)//2 (since result integer). Because parity ensures both differences even, sumU+sumV even.\n\nNow computing sum of absolute differences for a list of numbers can be done by sorting and using prefix sums: sum_{i} a_i * (2i - n +1) after sorting.\n\nSo algorithm:\n\n- Read N.\n- For each point, compute parity = (x+y) & 1.\n- Append u = x + y, v = x - y to list for that parity.\n- For each parity group (0 and 1):\n   - If size m <=1 continue.\n   - Sort u list, compute sumU = sum_{i} u[i] * i - prefix before? Actually formula: after sorting ascending, sum_{i} (u[i] * i - prefix_sum_before_i). This yields sum of differences where u[i] is larger element. So total sum = sum_{i} (u[i] * i - prefix_sum[i-1]).\n   - Similarly for v.\n   - Add to total sumU+sumV.\n- Finally answer = (total_sumU + total_sumV)//2.\n- Print answer.\n\nComplexities O(N log N). Use Python int (big). Ensure using long.\n\nEdge Cases: v = x - y can be negative, sorting works.\n\nTest with sample1: points (0,0): parity 0, u=0, v=0. (1,3): parity (1+3)=4 even =>0, u=4, v=-2. (5,6): parity 11 odd =>1, u=11, v=-1. Group0: u=[0,4], v=[0,-2]. sumU = |4-0|=4. sumV = |0-(-2)|=2. total =6, answer=3. matches.\n\nSample2: points: (0,5) parity 5 odd =>1, u=5, v=-5. (1,7) parity 8 even=>0, u=8, v=-6. (2,9) parity 11 odd=>1, u=11, v=-7. (3,8) parity 11 odd=>1, u=11, v=-5. (4,6) parity 10 even=>0, u=10, v=-2. Group0: points (1,7) u8 v-6; (4,6) u10 v-2. sumU=2, sumV=4 => total6 => answer3? Wait compute: sumU=|10-8|=2, sumV=|-2-(-6)|=4, total=6, half=3. Group1: points (0,5) u5 v-5; (2,9) u11 v-7; (3,8) u11 v-5. Compute sumU: sorted u [5,11,11]; differences: (11-5)+(11-5)+(11-11)=6+6+0=12. sumV: sorted v [-7,-5,-5]; differences: (-5-(-7)) + (-5-(-7)) + (-5-(-5)) =2+2+0=4. total=16, half=8.

Need to handle up to 1e5 operations, freq values up to 1e5 magnitude. Need to maintain multiset of IDs with counts. At each step, we add or remove certain number of copies of ID. After each step, we need the maximum frequency (i.e., the highest count of any ID) in the collection, and output that count (or 0 if empty). So we need to support increment/decrement of count of a key by delta (positive or negative), and after each operation, query the current maximum count among all keys.\n\nWe can maintain a dict id->count, and also a dict count->number of IDs having that count (frequency of frequencies). Keep track of current max count variable, updating when needed.\n\nWhen we add delta (positive) to id: old = cnt.get(id,0); new = old + delta. Since input guarantees no negative counts, new >=0. Update cnt[id]=new (if new==0, delete). Update freqCount: decrement freqCount[old] (if old>0), increment freqCount[new] (if new>0). Then adjust maxCount: if new > maxCount: maxCount = new. Else if old == maxCount and freqCount[old]==0: need to decrease maxCount to next lower count that has non-zero freqCount. Could while loop decreasing maxCount until freqCount[maxCount]>0 or maxCount==0.\n\nSimilarly for removal (delta negative): we treat delta = -freq[i] (positive) to subtract that many copies. So same logic.\n\nComplexities O(n + total adjustments of maxCount). In worst case maxCount could go up and down many times, but each decrement loop total steps bounded by total changes because maxCount only moves down when a count becomes empty, and each count value can become empty at most O(number of distinct changes). Since counts up to sum of positive freq (max 1e10? but each step delta up to 1e5, n up to 1e5, total sum up to 1e10, but maxCount may be large, but decrement loop could be large if we step one by one down from large to small many times. That could be O(total maxCount) which is too big. Need more efficient way to get max key with non-zero count. Use a heap (max-heap) of counts, but need to handle lazy deletion. Use a max-heap of (-count) or use heapq with negative counts. When we update a count, push new count onto heap. When querying, pop while top count not matching current freqCount (i.e., count not present or freqCount[count]==0). That gives O(log n) per operation.\n\nImplementation: maintain cnt dict, freqCount dict (maybe collections.Counter). Maintain heap list maxHeap storing negative counts. After each update, push -new if new>0.

Need to handle up to 1e5 operations, freq values up to 1e5 magnitude. Need to maintain multiset of IDs with counts. At each step, we add or remove certain number of copies of ID. After each step, we need the maximum frequency (i.e., the highest count of any ID) in the collection, and output that count (or 0 if empty). So we need to support increment/decrement of count of a key by delta (positive or negative), and after each operation, query the current maximum count among all keys.\n\nWe can maintain a dict id->count, and also a dict count->number of IDs having that count (frequency of frequencies). Keep track of current max count variable, updating when needed.\n\nWhen we add delta (positive) to id: old = cnt.get(id,0); new = old + delta. Since input guarantees no negative counts, new >=0. Update cnt[id]=new (if new==0, delete). Update freqCount: decrement freqCount[old] (if old>0), increment freqCount[new] (if new>0). Then adjust maxCount: if new > maxCount: maxCount = new. Else if old == maxCount and freqCount[old]==0: need to decrease maxCount to next lower count that has non-zero freqCount.

Since counts up to sum of positive freq (max 1e10? but each step delta up to 1e5, n up to 1e5, total sum up to 1e10, but maxCount may be large, but decrement loop could be large if we step one by one down from large to small many times. That could be O(total maxCount) which is too big. Need more efficient way to get max key with non-zero count. Use a heap (max-heap) of counts, but need to handle lazy deletion.

Need compute minimal expected cost.\n\nWe have large N up to 1e18, so need DP? Observations: operation reduces N multiplicatively. Since A small, and die values 1..6.\n\nWe can think of expected cost function f(n). For n=0, f(0)=0. For n>=1, we can choose either deterministic action: cost = X + f(floor(n/A)). Or stochastic action: we pay Y, then after seeing b, we go to floor(n/b). Since we can adapt after seeing b, the expected cost of die action is Y + (1/6) * sum_{b=1}^6 f(floor(n/b)). Because after seeing b, we can continue optimally, which is f(floor(n/b)). So optimal f(n) = min( X + f(floor(n/A)), Y + (1/6) * sum_{b=1}^6 f(floor(n/b)) ).\n\nWe need compute f(N). N up to 1e18, but A small, so recursion depth log_A N ~ up to 60. However die action leads to many possible smaller values, but still reduces quickly. Could use memoization with recursion and maybe compute for many n values? But N large, but the recursion will generate many distinct n values? For each n, we need f of floor(n/k) for k up to 6 and A. This forms a tree where each node reduces n by at least factor 2 (since min divisor is 2). So number of distinct n visited is O(log N). Actually floor division by up to 6 reduces size, but many branches may converge to same values. For example, floor(n/2), floor(n/3), etc. The set of reachable values from N via repeated floor division by integers 2..6 is limited: all numbers of form floor(N / product of some sequence). The count is O(log N) maybe times constant factor. Could use recursion with memo dict.\n\nImplement f(n) with memoization using recursion and compute min as above. Use float for expected cost.\n\nBase case: n==0 => 0. Also if n==1? floor(1/k) =0 for k>=2, but for k=1 (die can be 1) floor(1/1)=1, so could loop. Need to handle that. For die action, if b=1, floor(n/1)=n, no progress, could cause infinite loop. But we can still choose to pay Y and maybe get b=1, staying same, leading to infinite expected cost if we keep trying. However optimal strategy would not use die action if it can get stuck? Actually you can decide after seeing b=1, you can continue with other actions. So f(n) includes possibility that after die roll b=1, you are back at same n, but you have already paid Y. So the recurrence is correct: Y + (1/6)*( f(floor(n/1)) + ...). This leads to equation: f(n) = min( X + f(floor(n/A)), Y + (1/6)*( f(n) + sum_{b=2}^6 f(floor(n/b)) ) ). The second term includes f(n) on RHS, so we can solve for f(n) if we choose die action. Let S = sum_{b=2}^6 f(floor(n/b)). Then die expected cost = Y + (1/6)*( f(n) + S ). So if we denote D = Y + (1/6)*( f(n) + S ), then solving for f(n) = D gives f(n) = Y + (1/6)*( f(n) + S ) => f(n) - (1/6)f(n) = Y + S/6 => (5/6)f(n) = Y + S/6 => f(n) = (6/5)*( Y + S/6 ) = (6/5)*Y + (1/5)*S.\n\nThus the optimal expected cost when choosing die action is: cost_die = (6/5)*Y + (1/5)* sum_{b=2}^6 f(floor(n/b)). Note that we excluded b=1 term because it leads to recursion; the derived formula accounts for it.\n\nThus we can compute f(n) = min( X + f(floor(n/A)), (6/5)*Y + (1/5)* sum_{b=2}^6 f(floor(n/b)) ).\n\nNow base case: n=0 => 0. For n=1: floor(1/A)=0, floor(1/b) = 0 for b>=2, floor(1/1)=1 but not used in sum. So we can compute: option1 = X + f(0) = X. option2 = (6/5)*Y + (1/5)* sum_{b=2}^6 f(0) = (6/5)*Y. So f(1) = min(X, 1.2*Y). Works.\n\nThus recursion terminates.\n\nImplement memo recursion with dictionary. Since N up to 1e18, recursion depth maybe up to 60. Use sys.setrecursionlimit.\n\nCompute f(n) as float.\n\nEdge: need to handle large recursion but fine.\n\nImplement solve(): read N, A, X, Y from stdin (space separated). Compute f(N) and print with high precision (say 15 decimal). Use print(\"{:.15f}\".format(ans)).\n\nTest with given examples.\n\nLet's quickly test mentally: Example1: N=10, A=2, X=10, Y=20.

Recursion with memoisation  \n\nThe recurrence only needs values of `⌊n/k⌋` with `k∈{2,3,4,5,6,A}`.\nEach division reduces `n` by at least a factor of `2`, so the depth of the\nrecursion is at most `log₂ N ≤ 60`.  \nThe total number of distinct arguments that appear is also `O(log N)`,\nbecause many different paths lead to the same integer after flooring.\nConsequently a simple depth‑first recursion with a dictionary cache is fast\nenough even for `N = 10¹⁸`.\n\nThe algorithm:\n\n```\ndef f(n):\n    if n == 0: return 0.0\n    if n in memo: return memo[n]\n\n    # deterministic option\n    opt1 = X + f(n // A)\n\n    # random option\n    s = 0.0\n    for b in (2,3,4,5,6):\n        s += f(n // b)\n    opt2 = (6.0/5.0) * Y + (1.0/5.0) * s\n\n    ans = min(opt1, opt2)\n    memo[n] = ans\n    return ans\n```\n\nThe answer required by the problem is `f(N)`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimal possible expected cost.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor every `n ≥ 0` the value returned by `f(n)` satisfies the recurrence\n\n```\nf(n) = min( X + f(⌊n/A⌋) , (6/5)·Y + (1/5)· Σ_{b=2..6} f(⌊n/b⌋) )\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe function is defined exactly by this formula (base case `n=0` handled\nseparately). The memoised recursion evaluates the right‑hand side and stores\nthe result, therefore the returned value fulfills the equation. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor any `n ≥ 0`, `f(n)` equals the minimal expected cost achievable from state\n`n`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nInduction over the set of reachable states ordered by decreasing `n`.\n\n*Base*: `n = 0`. No further cost is needed, and `f(0)=0`. Minimality holds.\n\n*Induction step*: assume the statement true for all values `< n`.  \nConsider the first action taken from state `n`.\n\n* If we choose the deterministic action, we pay `X` and move to `⌊n/A⌋`.\n  By the induction hypothesis the optimal expected future cost from there is\n  `f(⌊n/A⌋)`. Total expected cost = `X + f(⌊n/A⌋)`.\n\n* If we choose the random action, we pay `Y` and observe `b`.  \n  For `b=1` we stay in `n`; for `b≥2` we go to `⌊n/b⌋`.  \n  Using the induction hypothesis for all those successors, the expected total\n  cost of *committing* to the random action satisfies the equation derived in\n  Section&nbsp;1, whose solution is exactly the expression\n  `(6/5)·Y + (1/5)· Σ_{b=2..6} f(⌊n/b⌋)`.\n\nNo other first move exists. Hence the optimal expected cost from `n` is the\nminimum of the two quantities above, which by Lemma&nbsp;1 equals `f(n)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe recursion terminates for every input `N`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nEach recursive call uses an argument `⌊n/k⌋` with `k ≥ 2`.  \nIf `n>0` then `⌊n/k⌋ < n`. Consequently the arguments strictly decrease and are\nnon‑negative integers, so after at most `log₂ N + 1` steps we reach `0`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm outputs the minimum possible expected total amount of money\nrequired to reduce the given `N` to `0`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the recursive computation finishes.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the value stored for each argument satisfies the recurrence.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 this value is exactly the optimal expected cost from that\nargument. In particular, the value returned for the original input `N` is the\ndesired optimum. The algorithm prints this value, therefore its output is\ncorrect. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Complexity Analysis  \n\nLet `M` be the number of distinct integers visited during the recursion.\nAs argued, `M = O(log N)`.\n\n*Time* – each of the `M` states is processed once, performing a constant amount\nof work (six divisions and a few arithmetic operations).  \n`T(N) = O(M) = O(log N)`.\n\n*Memory* – the memoisation dictionary stores `M` floating point numbers.  \n`S(N) = O(M) = O(log N)`.\n\nBoth bounds easily meet the limits for `N ≤ 10¹⁸`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

So if we denote D = Y + (1/6)*( f(n) + S ), then solving for f(n) = D gives f(n) = Y + (1/6)*( f(n) + S ) => f(n) - (1/6)f(n) = Y + S/6 => (5/6)f(n) = Y + S/6 => f(n) = (6/5)*( Y + S/6 ) = (6/5)*Y + (1/5)*S.\n\nThus the optimal expected cost when choosing die action is: cost_die = (6/5)*Y + (1/5)* sum_{b=2}^6 f(floor(n/b)). Note that we excluded b=1 term because it leads to recursion; the derived formula accounts for it.\n\nThus we can compute f(n) = min( X + f(floor(n/A)), (6/5)*Y + (1/5)* sum_{b=2}^6 f(floor(n/b)) ).\n\nNow base case: n=0 => 0. For n=1: floor(1/A)=0, floor(1/b) = 0 for b>=2, floor(1/1)=1 but not used in sum. So we can compute: option1 = X + f(0) = X. option2 = (6/5)*Y + (1/5)* sum_{b=2}^6 f(0) = (6/5)*Y. So f(1) = min(X, 1.2*Y). Works.\n\nThus recursion terminates.\n\nImplement memo recursion with dictionary. Since N up to 1e18, recursion depth maybe up to 60. Use sys.setrecursionlimit.\n\nCompute f(n) as float.\n\nEdge: need to handle large recursion but fine.\n\nImplement solve(): read N, A, X, Y from stdin (space separated). Compute f(N) and print with high precision (say 15 decimal). Use print(\"{:.15f}\".format(ans)).\n\nTest with given examples.\n\nLet's quickly test mentally: Example1: N=10, A=2, X=10, Y=20. Compute f(10). We'll trust.\n\nImplement iterative memo recursion.\n\nPotential performance: each call computes up to 5 recursive calls (b=2..6) plus one for A. So total nodes maybe O( (branch factor)^depth ) but many duplicates because floor division leads to same values. For N large, distinct values limited. Should be fine.\n\nImplement function f(n): if n in memo return. Compute nA = n//A. opt1 = X + f(nA). Compute sum_f = 0. for b in 2..6: sum_f += f(n//b). opt2 = (6/5)*Y + (1/5)*sum_f. ans = min(opt1, opt2). memo[n]=ans.\n\nReturn ans.\n\nEdge: A could be 2..6, same as die values.

Solving for `f(n)` gives the\nclosed form that can be used directly:\n\n```\ncost2 = (6/5)·Y + (1/5)· Σ_{b=2..6} f(⌊n/b⌋)\n```\n\nTherefore\n\n```\nf(n) = min( X + f(⌊n/A⌋) ,  (6/5)·Y + (1/5)· Σ_{b=2..6} f(⌊n/b⌋) )\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.   Recursion with memoisation  \n\nThe recurrence only needs values of `⌊n/k⌋` with `k∈{2,3,4,5,6,A}`.\nEach division reduces `n` by at least a factor of `2`, so the depth of the\nrecursion is at most `log₂ N ≤ 60`.  \nThe total number of distinct arguments that appear is also `O(log N)`,\nbecause many different paths lead to the same integer after flooring.\nConsequently a simple depth‑first recursion with a dictionary cache is fast\nenough even for `N = 10¹⁸`.\n\nThe algorithm:\n\n```\ndef f(n):\n    if n == 0: return 0.0\n    if n in memo: return memo[n]\n\n    # deterministic option\n    opt1 = X + f(n // A)\n\n    # random option\n    s = 0.0\n    for b in (2,3,4,5,6):\n        s += f(n // b)\n    opt2 = (6.0/5.0) * Y + (1.0/5.0) * s\n\n    ans = min(opt1, opt2)\n    memo[n] = ans\n    return ans\n```\n\nThe answer required by the problem is `f(N)`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimal possible expected cost.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor every `n ≥ 0` the value returned by `f(n)` satisfies the recurrence\n\n```\nf(n) = min( X + f(⌊n/A⌋) , (6/5)·Y + (1/5)· Σ_{b=2..6} f(⌊n/b⌋) )\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe function is defined exactly by this formula (base case `n=0` handled\nseparately). The memoised recursion evaluates the right‑hand side and stores\nthe result, therefore the returned value fulfills the equation. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor any `n ≥ 0`, `f(n)` equals the minimal expected cost achievable from state\n`n`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nInduction over the set of reachable states ordered by decreasing `n`.\n\n*Base*: `n = 0`. No further cost is needed, and `f(0)=0`. Minimality holds.\n\n*Induction step*: assume the statement true for all values `< n`.  \nConsider the first action taken from state `n`.\n\n* If we choose the deterministic action, we pay `X` and move to `⌊n/A⌋`.\n  By the induction hypothesis the optimal expected future cost from there is\n  `f(⌊n/A⌋)`. Total expected cost = `X + f(⌊n/A⌋)`.\n\n* If we choose the random action, we pay `Y` and observe `b`.  \n  For `b=1` we stay in `n`; for `b≥2` we go to `⌊n/b⌋`.  \n  Using the induction hypothesis for all those successors, the expected total\n  cost of *committing* to the random action satisfies the equation derived in\n  Section&nbsp;1, whose solution is exactly the expression\n  `(6/5)·Y + (1/5)· Σ_{b=2..6} f(⌊n/b⌋)`.\n\nNo other first move exists. Hence the optimal expected cost from `n` is the\nminimum of the two quantities above, which by Lemma&nbsp;1 equals `f(n)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe recursion terminates for every input `N`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nEach recursive call uses an argument `⌊n/k⌋` with `k ≥ 2`.  \nIf `n>0` then `⌊n/k⌋ < n`. Consequently the arguments strictly decrease and are\nnon‑negative integers, so after at most `log₂ N + 1` steps we reach `0`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm outputs the minimum possible expected total amount of money\nrequired to reduce the given `N` to `0`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the recursive computation finishes.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the value stored for each argument satisfies the recurrence.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 this value is exactly the optimal expected cost from that\nargument. In particular, the value returned for the original input `N` is the\ndesired optimum. The algorithm prints this value, therefore its output is\ncorrect. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Complexity Analysis  \n\nLet `M` be the number of distinct integers visited during the recursion.\nAs argued, `M = O(log N)`.\n\n*Time* – each of the `M` states is processed once, performing a constant amount\nof work (six divisions and a few arithmetic operations).  \n`T(N) = O(M) = O(log N)`.\n\n*Memory* – the memoisation dictionary stores `M` floating point numbers.  \n`S(N) = O(M) = O(log N)`.\n\nBoth bounds easily meet the limits for `N ≤ 10¹⁸`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

By induction each such `next` is winning for the opponent,\n  therefore the current player cannot avoid defeat. The stored value is\n  again correct.\n\nThus the claim holds for `k`, completing the induction. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \n`win[(1<<N)-1] = 1`  ⇔  Takahashi (the first player) has a winning\nstrategy.\n\n**Proof.** The initial mask contains all cards, exactly the position at\nthe start of the game with Takahashi to move.

By induction each such `next` is winning for the opponent,\n  therefore the current player cannot avoid defeat. The stored value is\n  again correct.\n\nThus the claim holds for `k`, completing the induction. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \n`win[(1<<N)-1] = 1`  ⇔  Takahashi (the first player) has a winning\nstrategy.\n\n**Proof.** The initial mask contains all cards, exactly the position at\nthe start of the game with Takahashi to move. By Lemma&nbsp;3 the stored\nvalue equals the true outcome for the player whose turn it is, i.e.\nTakahashi. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe program prints `\"Takahashi\"` iff Takahashi wins under optimal play,\notherwise it prints `\"Aoki\"`.\n\n**Proof.** The program computes `win[full_mask]` using the DP described\nabove and outputs `\"Takahashi\"` when the value is `1`, `\"Aoki\"` otherwise.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the value `1` is equivalent to Takahashi having a winning\nstrategy.

For each position, the distance between chars c1 and c2 is min((c2-c1) mod 26, (c1-c2) mod 26). That's the circular distance.\n\nWe can change any characters arbitrarily, each change contributes distance between original char and new char (the minimal cyclic distance). We have total budget k. Want lexicographically smallest t.\n\nWe need to construct t greedily from left to right: at each position, try to set the smallest possible character (from 'a' to 'z') such that we can still achieve total distance <= k given remaining positions.\n\nWe need to know for each position i, the minimal distance needed to change s[i] to some character c is d = cyclic_distance(s[i], c). For each position we have remaining budget. Greedy works because lexicographic order: earlier positions more important. Since distance costs are independent per position and additive, we can decide each position by trying smallest c where we can allocate remaining budget to later positions (i.e., there exists some assignment for later positions with total distance <= remaining_budget after using d). Since later positions can always be set to original characters (cost 0) or any other with cost up to 13 (max distance). So we need to know the minimal possible total distance for remaining positions (which is 0) and maximal possible (sum of max distances). Since we only have an upper bound k, we just need to ensure that after using d, the remaining budget is >=0 (since we can always spend less later). So we just need d <= remaining_k. That's it. Because we don't need to spend exactly k, just <=k. So we can always set later chars to original (cost 0). Therefore greedy: for each i, choose smallest c such that cyclic_distance(s[i], c) <= remaining_k. Then subtract that distance and continue.\n\nBut is there any scenario where using a small char now with small distance prevents achieving lexicographically smaller later? Since later positions can be unchanged, we don't need to allocate more budget. So greedy works.\n\nEdge case: maybe we could use more distance now to get smaller char later? No, lexicographic priority: earlier char more important, so we always want smallest possible at each position given budget.\n\nThus algorithm: iterate i from 0..n-1, for c in 'a'..'z', compute d = cyclic_distance(s[i], c).

For each position, the distance between chars c1 and c2 is min((c2-c1) mod 26, (c1-c2) mod 26). That's the circular distance.\n\nWe can change any characters arbitrarily, each change contributes distance between original char and new char (the minimal cyclic distance). We have total budget k. Want lexicographically smallest t.\n\nWe need to construct t greedily from left to right: at each position, try to set the smallest possible character (from 'a' to 'z') such that we can still achieve total distance <= k given remaining positions.\n\nWe need to know for each position i, the minimal distance needed to change s[i] to some character c is d = cyclic_distance(s[i], c). For each position we have remaining budget. Greedy works because lexicographic order: earlier positions more important. Since distance costs are independent per position and additive, we can decide each position by trying smallest c where we can allocate remaining budget to later positions (i.e., there exists some assignment for later positions with total distance <= remaining_budget after using d). Since later positions can always be set to original characters (cost 0) or any other with cost up to 13 (max distance). So we need to know the minimal possible total distance for remaining positions (which is 0) and maximal possible (sum of max distances). Since we only have an upper bound k, we just need to ensure that after using d, the remaining budget is >=0 (since we can always spend less later). So we just need d <= remaining_k. That's it. Because we don't need to spend exactly k, just <=k. So we can always set later chars to original (cost 0). Therefore greedy: for each i, choose smallest c such that cyclic_distance(s[i], c) <= remaining_k. Then subtract that distance and continue.\n\nBut is there any scenario where using a small char now with small distance prevents achieving lexicographically smaller later? Since later positions can be unchanged, we don't need to allocate more budget. So greedy works.\n\nEdge case: maybe we could use more distance now to get smaller char later? No, lexicographic priority: earlier char more important, so we always want smallest possible at each position given budget.\n\nThus algorithm: iterate i from 0..n-1, for c in 'a'..'z', compute d = cyclic_distance(s[i], c). If d <= k_remain, set t[i]=c, k_remain -= d, break.\n\nComplexities O(n*26).

Need efficient O(n). Manhattan distance between points i,j = |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|. The max distance among set is the diameter in L1 metric. Known that max Manhattan distance can be expressed via transformed coordinates: consider four forms: (x+y), (x - y), (-x + y), (-x - y). Actually max_{i,j} |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j| = max over four combinations: max_i (x_i + y_i) - min_i (x_i + y_i), max_i (x_i - y_i) - min_i (x_i - y_i). The overall max is max of those two differences. So the diameter is max of diff1, diff2.\n\nWhen we remove one point, we need to compute the resulting max distance efficiently. For each point removal, we need the max distance of remaining points. We can precompute for each of the four expressions the top two max values and bottom two min values and their indices. Then for removal of point k, the new max diff for expression e is:\n\nIf point k contributed to the global max (i.e., its value equals current max and its index is the max index), then after removal the max becomes second max; else remains same max. Similarly for min.\n\nThus for each point we can compute new diff1 = (max1' - min1'), diff2 = (max2' - min2'), where max1' is either global max1 or second max1 depending if removed point is the max index; min1' similarly. Then overall max distance after removal = max(diff1, diff2). Then answer = min over k of that.\n\nComplexities O(n). Need to handle ties: if multiple points share same max value, removal of one may still leave same max. So we need to store count? Simpler: store top two values with indices; if removed point index equals the index of the top value, we use second; else top. But if there are multiple points with same top value, and we remove one of them, the top value still remains because another point has same value. However our method would incorrectly drop to second if we only check index equality. To handle ties, we can store count of max value occurrences. If count>1, removal of any one point with that value still leaves max unchanged. So we need to know for each expression: max value, count of that value, second max value (strictly less). Similarly for min: min value, count, second min (strictly greater). Then for removal of point k, if its value == max and count==1, then new max = second max else same max.

Need efficient O(n). Manhattan distance between points i,j = |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|. The max distance among set is the diameter in L1 metric. Known that max Manhattan distance can be expressed via transformed coordinates: consider four forms: (x+y), (x - y), (-x + y), (-x - y). Actually max_{i,j} |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j| = max over four combinations: max_i (x_i + y_i) - min_i (x_i + y_i), max_i (x_i - y_i) - min_i (x_i - y_i). The overall max is max of those two differences. So the diameter is max of diff1, diff2.\n\nWhen we remove one point, we need to compute the resulting max distance efficiently. For each point removal, we need the max distance of remaining points. We can precompute for each of the four expressions the top two max values and bottom two min values and their indices. Then for removal of point k, the new max diff for expression e is:\n\nIf point k contributed to the global max (i.e., its value equals current max and its index is the max index), then after removal the max becomes second max; else remains same max. Similarly for min.\n\nThus for each point we can compute new diff1 = (max1' - min1'), diff2 = (max2' - min2'), where max1' is either global max1 or second max1 depending if removed point is the max index; min1' similarly. Then overall max distance after removal = max(diff1, diff2). Then answer = min over k of that.\n\nComplexities O(n). Need to handle ties: if multiple points share same max value, removal of one may still leave same max. So we need to store count? Simpler: store top two values with indices; if removed point index equals the index of the top value, we use second; else top. But if there are multiple points with same top value, and we remove one of them, the top value still remains because another point has same value. However our method would incorrectly drop to second if we only check index equality. To handle ties, we can store count of max value occurrences. If count>1, removal of any one point with that value still leaves max unchanged. So we need to know for each expression: max value, count of that value, second max value (strictly less). Similarly for min: min value, count, second min (strictly greater). Then for removal of point k, if its value == max and count==1, then new max = second max else same max.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm outputs the minimal possible span.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any `a (1 ≤ a ≤ N-K+1)` the set  \n`S_a = { pos[a] , pos[a+1] , … , pos[a+K-1] }`  \ncontains exactly the positions of a good index sequence, and its span\nequals `max(S_a) – min(S_a)`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy definition `pos[v]` is the unique index where value `v` appears.\nThe values `a … a+K-1` are `K` consecutive integers, therefore the\nindices `S_a` satisfy the required set condition.\nConversely any good index sequence must consist of `K` values that are\nconsecutive, thus it is exactly some `S_a`.  \nThe smallest index in the sequence is `min(S_a)`, the largest is\n`max(S_a)`, so the span is their difference. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nDuring the iteration with current `a` the algorithm’s heaps (after\ncleaning) contain precisely the multiset `S_a`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*Initialization* (`a = 1`): the algorithm inserts `pos[1] … pos[K]`,\nexactly `S_1`.  \n\n*Induction step*: assume before processing window `a` the heaps contain\n`S_a`. To obtain window `a+1` we remove `pos[a]` (value leaving) and add\n`pos[a+K]` (new value). The algorithm marks `pos[a]` as inactive and\npushes `pos[a+K]`. All other elements stay unchanged.\nAfter lazy‑deletion cleaning, the active elements are exactly\n`S_a \\ {pos[a]} ∪ {pos[a+K]} = S_{a+1}`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor each `a` the algorithm computes `cur_max - cur_min = max(S_a) -\nmin(S_a)`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the active elements in the heaps are exactly `S_a`.  \n`h_min` (after discarding inactive tops) yields the smallest active\nposition, i.e. `min(S_a)`.  \n`h_max` (negated) yields the largest active position, i.e. `max(S_a)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \n`answer` after the loop equals  \n`min_{a} ( max(S_a) - min(S_a) )`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe loop iterates over all possible `a` (from `1` to `N-K+1`).  \nAt each iteration it computes the span of `S_a` (Lemma&nbsp;3) and\nupdates `answer` with the minimum seen so far.  \nConsequently after the last iteration `answer` is the minimum over all\n`a`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm outputs the minimum possible value of `i_K - i_1` among\nall good index sequences.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 every good index sequence corresponds to exactly one\nwindow `S_a` and its span equals `max(S_a)-min(S_a)`.  \nLemma&nbsp;4 shows that the algorithm returns the minimum of those\nspans over all windows, which is therefore the minimum span over all\ngood index sequences. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Order doesn't matter (just set). So we need smallest span (max index - min index) covering K elements whose values form a consecutive block.\n\nWe need to compute minimal window length (span) covering K positions whose values are a consecutive range.\n\nWe can think sliding window over positions? Not straightforward because values need to be consecutive but not necessarily in order.\n\nWe can map each value to its position: pos[value] = index in permutation.\n\nWe need to choose K distinct values that are consecutive numbers, and consider their positions; we need max(pos) - min(pos). Want minimal over all consecutive value blocks of size K.\n\nThus for each a from 1 to N-K+1, consider values a..a+K-1, get their positions, compute span = max - min. Take min.\n\nWe need to compute efficiently O(N). Since N up to 2e5, K up to N.\n\nWe can precompute positions array of size N+1.\n\nNow we need sliding window over values: maintain multiset of positions to get current max and min. As we slide a from 1 to N-K+1, we add position of new value a+K-1, remove position of value a-1.\n\nWe need data structure supporting O(log K) min and max: we can use two heaps with lazy deletion, or use sorted list (bisect) like from bisect module with list, but removal O(K). Better use heap + dict for lazy deletion, or use \"sortedcontainers\" not allowed. Use two heaps: min-heap and max-heap (store negative). Also need to know when top is outdated (not in current window). We'll maintain a count dict of positions present. When we pop, if count[pos]==0, discard.\n\nImplementation: positions are unique (since permutation). So we can maintain a set of current positions, and also track current min and max via variables? Since we need min and max after each slide, we could maintain a balanced BST but not available. Use heap approach.\n\nInitialize window for a=1: include positions of values 1..K.

The description: \"then mark the unmarked element with the smallest value k_i in the array. If there are multiple such elements, mark the one with the smallest index. And if there are fewer than k_i unmarked elements, mark all of them.\" Wait ambiguous.\n\nLet's parse: \"mark the unmarked element with the smallest k_i in the array\" maybe means we need to mark k_i smallest unmarked elements (by value, tie by index). Actually example: first query [1,2] on nums = [1,2,2,1,2,3,1]. Initially all unmarked. Mark index 1 (value 2). Then need to mark k_i =2 smallest unmarked elements. After marking index1, unmarked elements values: indices 0:1,2:2,3:1,4:2,5:3,6:1. The smallest values are 1's at indices 0,3,6. Need to mark 2 of them (k_i=2) smallest by value then index. So we would mark indices 0 and 3 (both value 1). After that, marked indices: 1,0,3. Unmarked sum = values at indices 2,4,5,6 = 2+2+3+1=8 matches answer[0]=8. Yes.\n\nSecond query [3,3]: index 3 already marked, skip. Then need to mark k_i=3 smallest unmarked elements. Current unmarked indices: 2 (2),4 (2),5 (3),6 (1). Sorted by value then index: (1,6), (2,2), (2,4), (3,5). Need to mark 3 of them: indices 6,2,4. After marking, remaining unmarked: index5 (value3). Sum =3 matches answer[1]=3.\n\nThird query [4,2]: index4 already marked, skip. Need to mark k_i=2 smallest unmarked elements. Currently only index5 unmarked (value3). Since fewer than k_i, mark all (i.e., index5). Then sum =0 matches answer[2]=0.\n\nThus algorithm: maintain set of unmarked elements with ability to get smallest by value then index, and also ability to remove arbitrary index (when marking index_i). Need to support up to 1e5 operations, each query may need to remove up to k_i elements (k_i up to n). Total removals across all queries is at most n (since each element can be marked only once). So we can process by repeatedly popping smallest unmarked element up to k_i times.\n\nData structure: Use heap of (value, index) for unmarked elements. Also need a boolean array marked. When we need to mark index_i, if not marked, mark it and also need to remove it from heap lazily (i.e., when popped later, skip if already marked). For marking k_i smallest, we pop from heap while count < k_i and heap not empty, each popped element if already marked skip else mark it.\n\nWe also need to maintain current sum of unmarked elements to compute answer after each query.

Wait description: \"ค่าของอาร์เรย์จะเท่ากับองค์ประกอบสุดท้ายของอาร์เรย์นั้น\" Means \"the value of the array equals the last element of that array\". So each subarray's value is its last element (i.e., nums[r_i]). Need to partition into m subarrays where each subarray's bitwise AND equals given andValues[i]. Among all possible partitions, minimize sum of last elements of each subarray. Return that sum, or -1 if impossible.\n\nCheck example1: partition [1,4] last element 4, [3] last 3, [3] last 3, [2] last 2 sum=12 matches. andValues are [0,3,3,2] correspond to each subarray's AND.\n\nExample2: nums = [2,3,5,7,7,7,5], andValues=[0,7,5].

We can DP over positions and segment index.\n\nWe need to find for each start index i and segment k (0-indexed for andValues), the minimal possible ending index j (>=i) such that AND of nums[i..j] == andValues[k]. Also we need to know the minimal last element value (which is nums[j]) for that segment, but we also need to consider future segments.\n\nWe can DP: dp[pos][k] = minimal sum for partitioning first pos elements (0..pos-1) into k segments satisfying first k andValues. pos is index after last used element. dp[0][0]=0.

Since AND is monotonic decreasing (bits only turn off). If target AND is V, then as we extend, current AND will be some value cur. Once cur < V (i.e., bits missing that are in V), it can never become V again because bits only turn off. So we can stop when (cur & V) != V (i.e., cur missing bits). Actually need cur == V at some point. Since cur only decreases, once cur < V (in terms of bits), cannot recover. So we can stop when (cur | V) != cur? Wait cur has bits subset of previous cur. If V has a bit 1 that cur doesn't have, then cur cannot become V later. So break when (cur & V) != V.\n\nThus for each start, we can iterate until cur becomes less than V in bits, which may be early.

So total cost is total number of pairs (i,j) with i<j and t[i]==t[j]. That's essentially number of equal-character pairs (i<j). That's sum over each character of C(cnt,2). So minimizing total cost means we want to minimize sum over characters of cnt choose 2. Since total length fixed, we want to distribute characters as evenly as possible to minimize collisions. The minimal possible cost is achieved when each character appears at most once, i.e., all characters distinct, giving cost 0. But alphabet size is 26, and length up to 1e5, so cannot have all distinct if length >26. So we need to assign letters to '?' to minimize sum of C(cnt,2). This is like we have existing counts from fixed letters, and we can add counts for '?'.\n\nGoal: choose letters for each '?' to minimize total sum of C(cnt,2). Equivalent to minimize sum cnt^2 (since C(cnt,2)=cnt*(cnt-1)/2 = (cnt^2 - cnt)/2, sum of -cnt is constant total length, so minimizing sum cnt^2). So we need to allocate the k '?' among 26 letters to minimize sum of squares of final counts, given initial counts a_i (i=0..25). This is classic: to minimize sum of squares, we should always add to the currently smallest count (greedy). Since each addition increments count by 1, we can think of distributing k increments to the smallest counts each time. This yields final counts as balanced as possible, i.e., the counts differ by at most 1.\n\nThus algorithm: compute counts of existing letters. Let k = number of '?'. Use a priority queue (min-heap) of (count, letter). For each of k times, pop smallest count, increment count, push back. After distribution, we have final counts.\n\nNow we need to construct the resulting string: we need to replace each '?' with letters such that final counts match the distribution, and also produce lexicographically smallest string among those achieving minimal cost.\n\nGiven we have determined final counts per letter (target counts). We need to assign letters to each '?' position in order to get lexicographically smallest overall string. Since we already have fixed letters at other positions, we cannot change them. For each '?', we can choose any letter that still has remaining quota (target count - already placed count). To get lexicographically smallest overall string, we should assign the smallest possible letter at each '?' position that still allows completing the remaining quotas later. This is similar to constructing lexicographically smallest string given multiset of letters to place in certain positions.\n\nWe can process positions left to right. Keep remaining_needed[letter] = target count - current_fixed_count (including already placed from earlier '?' replacements). At each '?', we try letters from 'a' to 'z', pick the first letter such that if we assign it now, the remaining_needed for that letter after decrement is still feasible to fill the remaining '?' positions later (i.e., sum of remaining_needed equals remaining '?' count after this position). Since we always have enough total letters, the feasibility condition is simply that we don't run out of needed letters for later positions. The greedy of picking smallest possible that still leaves enough total capacity works.\n\nSimplify: Since we know total remaining_needed sum equals remaining '?' count, picking the smallest letter with remaining_needed>0 will always be feasible because we can assign the rest later arbitrarily. There's no other constraints like ordering. So we can just at each '?', assign the smallest letter that still has remaining_needed>0.

So essentially we need to count triples (i,j), (i,k), (l,j) where grid[i][j]=grid[i][k]=grid[l][j]=1, with k != j, l != i. The right angle is at (i,j). Also could be right angle at other vertices? The definition: \"if one element is in the same row as another element and in the same column as the third element\". That suggests the right angle is at the element that shares row with one and column with the other. So each right triangle is defined by a pivot cell (i,j) that is 1, and another 1 in same row (i,k) with k != j, and another 1 in same column (l,j) with l != i. The third point (l,k) is not required to be 1. So each combination of a pivot and a row neighbor and column neighbor forms a right triangle. So count for each pivot cell the number of other 1s in its row times number of other 1s in its column. Sum over all pivot cells.\n\nBut careful: each triangle counted once? Suppose we have points A (i,j), B (i,k), C (l,j). The right angle is at A. Could also be considered right angle at B? B shares row with A and column with some D? Not same triangle. So each triangle has a unique right angle at the intersection of the row and column lines. So counting as above is correct.\n\nThus algorithm: For each row, compute count of 1s.

So essentially we need to count triples (i,j), (i,k), (l,j) where grid[i][j]=grid[i][k]=grid[l][j]=1, with k != j, l != i. The right angle is at (i,j). Also could be right angle at other vertices? The definition: \"if one element is in the same row as another element and in the same column as the third element\". That suggests the right angle is at the element that shares row with one and column with the other. So each right triangle is defined by a pivot cell (i,j) that is 1, and another 1 in same row (i,k) with k != j, and another 1 in same column (l,j) with l != i. The third point (l,k) is not required to be 1. So each combination of a pivot and a row neighbor and column neighbor forms a right triangle. So count for each pivot cell the number of other 1s in its row times number of other 1s in its column. Sum over all pivot cells.\n\nBut careful: each triangle counted once? Suppose we have points A (i,j), B (i,k), C (l,j). The right angle is at A. Could also be considered right angle at B? B shares row with A and column with some D? Not same triangle. So each triangle has a unique right angle at the intersection of the row and column lines. So counting as above is correct.\n\nThus algorithm: For each row, compute count of 1s. For each column, compute count of 1s. Then iterate over each cell with value 1, add (rowCount[i]-1)*(colCount[j]-1) to total.\n\nComplexities O(N*M).

Return the sum of powers of all subsequences of nums? Wait: The description is confusing. It says: \"power of array of integers is defined as the number of subsequences that have sum equal to k.

But each subsequence itself is an array; its power is the number of its own subsequences that sum to k. Then we sum those powers over all subsequences of the original array. That's what examples illustrate.\n\nExample 1: nums=[1,2,3], k=3. They say there are 5 subsequences of nums with non-zero power. They list each subsequence (maybe they are: [1,2,3] (the whole), [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [3]? Actually need to compute). Let's compute powers:\n\nAll subsequences of [1,2,3] (including empty) are 2^3=8: [], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].\n\nNow for each subsequence, compute its power = number of its own subsequences that sum to k=3.\n\n- []: sum 0, no subsequence sum 3 => power 0.\n- [1]: subsequences: [], [1]; sums:0,1 => power 0.\n- [2]: sums 0,2 => power 0.\n- [3]: subsequences: [], [3]; sum 3 appears in [3] => power 1.\n- [1,2]: subsequences: [],[1],[2],[1,2]; sums:0,1,2,3 => power 1 (subsequence [1,2]).\n- [1,3]: subsequences: [],[1],[3],[1,3]; sums:0,1,3,4 => power 1 (subsequence [3] or [1,3]? Actually sum 3 appears in [3] and also [1,2]? Wait [1,3] sum 4, not 3. So only [3] gives sum 3). So power 1.\n- [2,3]: subsequences: [],[2],[3],[2,3]; sums:0,2,3,5 => power 1 (subsequence [3]).\n- [1,2,3]: subsequences: many; which sum to 3? [1,2], [3] maybe also? [1,2] sum 3, [3] sum 3. That's 2. So power 2.\n\nNow sum of powers = 0+0+0+1+1+1+1+2 = 6. Matches example.\n\nThus problem: Given nums length n <=100, k <=100, compute sum over all subsequences S of nums of (number of subsequences of S whose sum equals k). Equivalent to: For each subsequence S, count number of subsets (sub-subsequences) of S that sum to k, and sum over all S.\n\nWe need efficient computation. Brute force over all 2^n subsequences is impossible for n=100.\n\nWe need combinatorial counting. Let's think: For each subset T of original array that sums to k, how many supersets S (i.e., subsequences of original array) contain T as a subsequence? Because each occurrence of T as a subsequence of S contributes 1 to power of S. So total sum = sum over all subsets T with sum k of (number of supersets S that contain T as a subsequence). Since S is any subsequence of original array that includes all elements of T (preserving order). The number of supersets S that contain T is equal to 2^{(n - |U|)} where U is the set of positions not in T? Wait we need to consider positions: Original array indices 0..n-1. A subset T corresponds to a set of indices I (ordered). Any superset S corresponds to a superset of indices J where I ⊆ J ⊆ [0..n-1]. So number of supersets = 2^{n - |I|}. Because each of the remaining n - |I| indices can be either included or not. So each T contributes 2^{n - |T|} to total sum.\n\nThus total answer = Σ_{T subset of indices, sum(nums[i] for i in T) = k} 2^{n - |T|} mod MOD.\n\nWe need to compute this efficiently. n up to 100, k up to 100, nums[i] up to 1e4 but sum limited to k (100). So we can DP over positions and sum and size.\n\nWe need to compute for each possible sum s (0..k) and size t (0..n) the number of subsets (subsequences) of original array with sum s and size t. Let's denote dp[s][t] = count of subsets with sum s and size t. Then answer = Σ_{t=0..n} dp[k][t] * 2^{n - t}.\n\nWe can compute dp using iterative DP: start dp[0][0]=1. For each num in nums, update dp in reverse sum and size: for s from k down to num, for t from current max down to 1: dp[s][t] += dp[s-num][t-1].\n\nComplexities O(n * k * n) = O(n^2 * k) = up to 100*100*100 = 1e6 fine.\n\nWe also need precompute powers of 2 modulo MOD up to n.\n\nEdge Cases: dp values can be large, use modulo.\n\nReturn answer % MOD.\n\nTest with examples.\n\nLet's implement function sum_of_powers(nums, k).

The number of supersets S that contain T is equal to 2^{(n - |U|)} where U is the set of positions not in T? Wait we need to consider positions: Original array indices 0..n-1. A subset T corresponds to a set of indices I (ordered). Any superset S corresponds to a superset of indices J where I ⊆ J ⊆ [0..n-1]. So number of supersets = 2^{n - |I|}. Because each of the remaining n - |I| indices can be either included or not. So each T contributes 2^{n - |T|} to total sum.\n\nThus total answer = Σ_{T subset of indices, sum(nums[i] for i in T) = k} 2^{n - |T|} mod MOD.\n\nWe need to compute this efficiently. n up to 100, k up to 100, nums[i] up to 1e4 but sum limited to k (100). So we can DP over positions and sum and size.\n\nWe need to compute for each possible sum s (0..k) and size t (0..n) the number of subsets (subsequences) of original array with sum s and size t. Let's denote dp[s][t] = count of subsets with sum s and size t. Then answer = Σ_{t=0..n} dp[k][t] * 2^{n - t}.\n\nWe can compute dp using iterative DP: start dp[0][0]=1. For each num in nums, update dp in reverse sum and size: for s from k down to num, for t from current max down to 1: dp[s][t] += dp[s-num][t-1].\n\nComplexities O(n * k * n) = O(n^2 * k) = up to 100*100*100 = 1e6 fine.\n\nWe also need precompute powers of 2 modulo MOD up to n.\n\nEdge Cases: dp values can be large, use modulo.\n\nReturn answer % MOD.\n\nTest with examples.\n\nLet's implement function sum_of_powers(nums, k). Return int.\n\nCheck example 1: nums=[1,2,3], n=3, k=3.\n\nCompute subsets with sum 3:\n\n- size 1: [3] => dp[3][1]=1\n- size 2: [1,2] => dp[3][2]=1\n- size 3: none.\n\nAnswer = dp[3][1]*2^{2} + dp[3][2]*2^{1} = 1*4 + 1*2 = 6. Works.\n\nExample 2: nums=[2,3,3], k=5.\n\nSubsets sum 5: size 2: [2,3] (two possibilities because there are two 3's). So dp[5][2]=2. No size 1. Answer = 2 * 2^{1} = 2*2=4. Works.\n\nExample 3: no subsets sum 7 => answer 0.\n\nThus solution.\n\nImplement with list of lists dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(k+1)].\n\nIterate each num.\n\nComplexities fine.\n\nReturn answer.\n\nNow produce final code block with function definition only.", "signature": null, "redacted": false}, {"internal": null, "type": "text", "text": "```python\ndef sum_of_powers(nums, k):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    n = len(nums)\n    # dp[s][t] = number of subsets with sum s and size t\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n    for val in nums:\n        # iterate sums and sizes in reverse to avoid reuse within same iteration\n        for s in range(k, val - 1, -1):\n            row_prev = dp[s - val]\n            row_cur = dp[s]\n            for t in range(n, 0, -1):\n                row_cur[t] = (row_cur[t] + row_prev[t - 1]) % MOD\n    # precompute powers of 2\n    pow2 = [1] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        pow2[i] = (pow2[i - 1] * 2) % MOD\n    ans = 0\n    for t in range(1, n + 1):\n        ans = (ans + dp[k][t] * pow2[n - t]) % MOD\n    return ans\n```", "refusal": null}], "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "gpt-oss-120b"}], "metadata": {"task_id": "3345", "question_title": "หาผลรวมของกำลังของลำดับทั้งหมด", "test_cases": [{"input": "[1, 2, 3]\n3", "output": "6", "testtype": "functional"}, {"input": "[2, 3, 3]\n5", "output": "4", "testtype": "functional"}, {"input": "[1, 2, 3]\n7", "output": "0", "testtype": "functional"}], "public_test_cases": [{"input": "[1, 2, 3]\n3", "output": "6", "testtype": "functional"}, {"input": "[2, 3, 3]\n5", "output": "4", "testtype": "functional"}, {"input": "[1, 2, 3]\n7", "output": "0", "testtype": "functional"}], "private_test_cases": [], "difficulty": "hard", "starter_code": "class Solution:\n    def sumOfPower(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        ", "requires_stdin": false}}

For each empty cell ('.'), we need to compute its \"degree of freedom\": number of cells reachable via repeated moves under the rule: you can move to adjacent (up/down/left/right) cell only if none of the four orthogonal neighbors of your current cell have a magnet (#). Wait reading: \"If any cell in vertical or horizontal direction adjacent to the current cell has a magnet, he cannot move at all.\" Actually statement: \"If any cell in vertical or horizontal that is adjacent to the current cell has a magnet, he will not be able to move at all.\" Means if any of the four neighboring cells (up/down/left/right) contains a magnet, then from that cell you cannot move anywhere (i.e., you are stuck). Otherwise, you can move to any adjacent cell (up/down/left/right) that is within grid (regardless of whether that adjacent cell has a magnet? But you cannot move into a magnet cell because it's not empty? The problem says some cells may have magnets (maybe zero). The movement rule: \"If any cell in vertical or horizontal that is adjacent to the current cell has a magnet, he will not be able to move at all - otherwise he can move to any adjacent cell in vertical or horizontal. However, he cannot leave the grid.\" It doesn't explicitly forbid moving into a magnet cell, but the definition of degree of freedom is for cells without magnets, and reachable cells are those he can access via moves, presumably only through empty cells because you cannot occupy a magnet cell? The problem likely expects that you cannot step onto a magnet cell because it's occupied. Usually such problems treat # as blocked. So reachable cells are empty cells only, and movement is allowed only from a cell that has no adjacent magnets. So you can move from a cell only if all its four neighbors are '.' or out of bounds (i.e., no adjacent #). If that condition holds, you can move to any adjacent empty cell (since moving into a # would be invalid). So essentially, we have a graph where vertices are empty cells. An edge exists between two adjacent empty cells if both cells satisfy the condition? Actually movement from cell A to B requires that A has no adjacent magnets. It does not require B to have no adjacent magnets (since you can move into B, but then from B you may be stuck). So directed edges from A to B if A has no adjacent # and B is adjacent and empty. However reachability is via repeated moves, so you can traverse directed edges. So reachable set from start is all nodes reachable via directed graph.\n\nWe need for each empty cell, compute size of reachable set (including itself). Then output max.\n\nConstraints up to 1000x1000 = 1e6 cells. Need O(N) or O(N log N). Graph is directed but we can think of SCCs? Since edges are only from cells with no adjacent #. Those cells are \"free\" nodes that can move outward. If a cell has adjacent #, it has out-degree 0 (cannot move). So reachable set from any node is: you can move from that node only if it is \"free\". If not free, reachable set is just itself (size 1). If free, you can move to neighbors (empty). Those neighbors may be free or not. So reachable set is all nodes reachable via paths where each step's source node is free. This is like we have a directed graph where edges go from free nodes to adjacent empty nodes. This graph is acyclic? Could have cycles: if two free nodes adjacent, each can move to the other, so bidirectional edges, forming SCC. So reachable set from any node is the union of SCC reachable forward.\n\nWe need size of reachable set for each node. Could compute using reverse topological order on condensation DAG. Since graph size up to 1e6, we need linear algorithm.\n\nApproach: Build adjacency list implicitly. Compute SCCs using Kosaraju or Tarjan O(N). Then condensation DAG (directed). For each SCC, compute its size (number of nodes). Then compute DP: reachable size from each SCC = size of SCC + sum of reachable sizes of successor SCCs (but careful to avoid double counting because DAG may have multiple paths to same SCC). Actually reachable set from a node is all nodes reachable via directed paths, which is the union of SCCs reachable. Since DAG may have merging, we need to compute total number of distinct nodes reachable, not sum over paths. That's essentially the size of the reachable subgraph (union). That's a classic problem of counting reachable nodes in DAG, which can be done via DP with bitsets (too large) or using DP with memoization of sets? Not feasible.\n\nBut maybe the graph structure is simpler: edges only go from free cells to any neighbor, regardless of neighbor's status. So if a cell is not free, it has out-degree 0, but can have incoming edges from free neighbors. So any path can only have internal nodes that are free except possibly the last node (which could be non-free). So any reachable node is either free or non-free, but after reaching a non-free node you cannot go further. So any path can have at most one non-free node at the end. Therefore reachable set from a start node consists of: all free nodes reachable via paths staying within free nodes (since you can move from free to free), plus any non-free neighbor reachable directly from a free node (i.e., any non-free node that is adjacent to some free node reachable). But you cannot go from a non-free node to another node.\n\nThus reachable set = union of:\n- all free nodes in the connected component of the undirected graph induced by free cells (since edges between free cells are bidirectional because both are free, each can move to the other). Actually if both are free, each can move to the other, so they are strongly connected. So each free component forms an SCC (maybe multiple SCCs if there are free cells adjacent to non-free cells? But free cells adjacent to each other are mutually reachable, so they are in same SCC). So SCCs of free cells are just connected components of free cells (undirected). Because any edge between free cells is bidirectional, making them strongly connected. So each free component is an SCC.\n\n- For each free component, there may be outgoing edges to adjacent non-free empty cells (i.e., '.' cells that have at least one adjacent #). Those non-free cells have out-degree 0, so they are sink SCCs of size 1.\n\nThus condensation DAG is a bipartite: each free component points to some sink non-free cells (maybe multiple). No edges between non-free cells (since they have out-degree 0). No edges from non-free to anything. No edges from free component to another free component (since they would be connected via free cells, thus same component). So DAG is simple: each free component has edges to some sink nodes.\n\nTherefore reachable set from any node:\n- If node is non-free: size =1.\n- If node is free: reachable = size of its free component + number of distinct non-free neighbor cells adjacent to any cell in that component.\n\nThus we can compute for each free component: its size (count of free cells) and the set of adjacent non-free empty cells (unique). The degree of freedom = component size + count of adjacent non-free cells.\n\nWe need max over all empty cells. For non-free cells, degree =1, which may be max if all components size+adjacent =1.\n\nImplementation steps:\n- Read grid.\n- Determine for each empty cell whether it is free: check its four neighbors for any '#'. If any neighbor is '#', then not free. Edge cells treat out-of-bounds as no magnet (so not counted). So free if all existing orthogonal neighbors are not '#'.\n- Use DSU or BFS to find connected components among free cells (adjacent 4-direction). Use BFS/DFS with visited array.\n- For each component, maintain size and a set (or count) of adjacent non-free empty cells. To avoid storing large sets, we can mark each non-free cell and count unique per component. Since each non-free cell may be adjacent to multiple free cells within same component, we need to ensure counted once. Approach: during BFS of component, for each neighbor cell that is empty ('.') but not free, we can add its index to a set (e.g., Python set) for that component. Component size up to 1e6, but total non-free cells also up to 1e6, sets overall memory okay. However worst-case each component could be large and have many adjacent non-free cells, but total adjacency edges is O(N). So using set per component is okay.\n\nAlternative: assign each non-free cell an id, and during BFS we can add to a list and later deduplicate via a global visited timestamp array per component. Use a global array 'last_seen' of size N to store component id when counted. For each component, we increment component id, and when encountering a non-free neighbor cell, if last_seen[idx] != comp_id, then increment count and set last_seen[idx]=comp_id. This avoids per-component set overhead.\n\nWe'll implement using 1D index = i*W + j.\n\nAlgorithm:\n- Parse grid into list of strings.\n- Create boolean arrays: is_empty (grid[i][j]=='.'), is_free (empty and no adjacent '#').\n- visited_free = boolean array.\n- last_seen = array of ints initialized 0, size N.\n- comp_id = 1.. etc.\n- max_degree = 1 (since at least one empty cell).\n- For each cell that is empty and free and not visited:\n    - BFS queue.\n    - comp_size =0\n    - adj_nonfree =0\n    - while queue:\n        - pop cell.\n        - comp_size+=1\n        - for each 4 neighbor:\n            - if inside grid:\n                - if grid[ni][nj]=='#': continue (but free condition already ensures none)\n                - if is_empty:\n                    - if is_free and not visited: add to queue, visited.\n                    - else (non-free): idx = ni*W+nj; if last_seen[idx]!=comp_id: last_seen[idx]=comp_id; adj_nonfree+=1\n    - degree = comp_size + adj_nonfree\n    - max_degree = max(max_degree, degree)\n- After processing all free components, also consider non-free empty cells: degree=1, but max already at least 1.\n\nEdge Cases: isolated free cell with no adjacent non-free cells: degree =1 (size 1 + 0).

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm outputs the maximum degree of freedom.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nA blocked empty cell cannot move to any other cell.\n\n**Proof.** By definition a blocked cell has at least one adjacent `#`.\nThe movement rule forbids any move from such a cell. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nAll free cells that are 4‑connected belong to the same SCC of the directed\ngraph.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf two free cells `a` and `b` are neighbours, the movement rule allows a move\n`a → b` (source `a` is free) and also `b → a` (source `b` is free).  \nThus every edge between neighbouring free cells is bidirectional.\nConsequently any two free cells that are connected by a path of neighbour\nsteps have directed paths in both directions, i.e. they are mutually reachable\nand belong to the same SCC. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a free component `C` let `B(C)` be the set of blocked empty cells that are\nadjacent to at least one cell of `C`.  \nFor every cell `v ∈ C` the set of cells reachable from `v` is exactly\n`C ∪ B(C)`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Containment*  \n* Inside `C` we can move freely because every step starts from a free cell,\n  therefore all cells of `C` are reachable.\n* From any cell of `C` we may step to a neighbour that is blocked (it is\n  allowed because the source is free). Hence every cell of `B(C)` is reachable.\n\n*No other cells*  \nConsider any reachable cell `x` that is not in `C`.  \nThe first step that leaves `C` must go from a free cell (still inside `C`) to\na neighbour `y`. By the movement rule `y` must be empty; if `y` were free,\nit would belong to `C` (Lemma&nbsp;2), contradicting that `x ∉ C`.  \nThus `y` is blocked, and because blocked cells have out‑degree 0\n(Lemma&nbsp;1) the walk stops at `y`. Therefore `x` is a blocked neighbour of\n`C`, i.e. `x ∈ B(C)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm computes for each free component `C` the value\n`|C| + |B(C)|`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nDuring BFS of `C` the algorithm\n\n* counts every visited free cell – exactly `|C|`;\n* examines all four neighbours of each visited cell.\n  Whenever a neighbour is a blocked empty cell, its linear index `idx` is\n  considered. The array `last_seen` guarantees that this neighbour contributes\n  at most once to `adj_cnt`. Hence `adj_cnt` equals the number of distinct\n  blocked neighbours, i.e. `|B(C)|`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nFor every empty cell `v` the algorithm records a degree of freedom equal to\nthe true number of cells reachable from `v`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If `v` is blocked*: the algorithm never puts it into a free component,\nso the global maximum is compared with `1`. By Lemma&nbsp;1 the reachable set\nis `{v}`, size `1`.  \n\n*If `v` is free*: `v` belongs to a unique free component `C`.  \nThe algorithm computes `|C| + |B(C)|` for `C` (Lemma&nbsp;4) and uses this\nvalue for all its cells.

For each empty cell ('.'), we need to compute its \"degree of freedom\": number of cells reachable via repeated moves under the rule: you can move to adjacent (up/down/left/right) cell only if none of the four orthogonal neighbors of your current cell have a magnet (#). Wait reading: \"If any cell in vertical or horizontal direction adjacent to the current cell has a magnet, he cannot move at all.\" Actually statement: \"If any cell in vertical or horizontal that is adjacent to the current cell has a magnet, he will not be able to move at all.\" Means if any of the four neighboring cells (up/down/left/right) contains a magnet, then from that cell you cannot move anywhere (i.e., you are stuck). Otherwise, you can move to any adjacent cell (up/down/left/right) that is within grid (regardless of whether that adjacent cell has a magnet? But you cannot move into a magnet cell because it's not empty? The problem says some cells may have magnets (maybe zero). The movement rule: \"If any cell in vertical or horizontal that is adjacent to the current cell has a magnet, he will not be able to move at all - otherwise he can move to any adjacent cell in vertical or horizontal. However, he cannot leave the grid.\" It doesn't explicitly forbid moving into a magnet cell, but the definition of degree of freedom is for cells without magnets, and reachable cells are those he can access via moves, presumably only through empty cells because you cannot occupy a magnet cell? The problem likely expects that you cannot step onto a magnet cell because it's occupied. Usually such problems treat # as blocked. So reachable cells are empty cells only, and movement is allowed only from a cell that has no adjacent magnets. So you can move from a cell only if all its four neighbors are '.' or out of bounds (i.e., no adjacent #). If that condition holds, you can move to any adjacent empty cell (since moving into a # would be invalid). So essentially, we have a graph where vertices are empty cells. An edge exists between two adjacent empty cells if both cells satisfy the condition? Actually movement from cell A to B requires that A has no adjacent magnets. It does not require B to have no adjacent magnets (since you can move into B, but then from B you may be stuck). So directed edges from A to B if A has no adjacent # and B is adjacent and empty. However reachability is via repeated moves, so you can traverse directed edges. So reachable set from start is all nodes reachable via directed graph.\n\nWe need for each empty cell, compute size of reachable set (including itself). Then output max.\n\nConstraints up to 1000x1000 = 1e6 cells. Need O(N) or O(N log N). Graph is directed but we can think of SCCs? Since edges are only from cells with no adjacent #. Those cells are \"free\" nodes that can move outward. If a cell has adjacent #, it has out-degree 0 (cannot move). So reachable set from any node is: you can move from that node only if it is \"free\". If not free, reachable set is just itself (size 1). If free, you can move to neighbors (empty). Those neighbors may be free or not. So reachable set is all nodes reachable via paths where each step's source node is free. This is like we have a directed graph where edges go from free nodes to adjacent empty nodes. This graph is acyclic? Could have cycles: if two free nodes adjacent, each can move to the other, so bidirectional edges, forming SCC. So reachable set from any node is the union of SCC reachable forward.\n\nWe need size of reachable set for each node. Could compute using reverse topological order on condensation DAG. Since graph size up to 1e6, we need linear algorithm.\n\nApproach: Build adjacency list implicitly. Compute SCCs using Kosaraju or Tarjan O(N). Then condensation DAG (directed). For each SCC, compute its size (number of nodes). Then compute DP: reachable size from each SCC = size of SCC + sum of reachable sizes of successor SCCs (but careful to avoid double counting because DAG may have multiple paths to same SCC). Actually reachable set from a node is all nodes reachable via directed paths, which is the union of SCCs reachable. Since DAG may have merging, we need to compute total number of distinct nodes reachable, not sum over paths. That's essentially the size of the reachable subgraph (union). That's a classic problem of counting reachable nodes in DAG, which can be done via DP with bitsets (too large) or using DP with memoization of sets? Not feasible.\n\nBut maybe the graph structure is simpler: edges only go from free cells to any neighbor, regardless of neighbor's status. So if a cell is not free, it has out-degree 0, but can have incoming edges from free neighbors. So any path can only have internal nodes that are free except possibly the last node (which could be non-free). So any reachable node is either free or non-free, but after reaching a non-free node you cannot go further. So any path can have at most one non-free node at the end. Therefore reachable set from a start node consists of: all free nodes reachable via paths staying within free nodes (since you can move from free to free), plus any non-free neighbor reachable directly from a free node (i.e., any non-free node that is adjacent to some free node reachable). But you cannot go from a non-free node to another node.\n\nThus reachable set = union of:\n- all free nodes in the connected component of the undirected graph induced by free cells (since edges between free cells are bidirectional because both are free, each can move to the other). Actually if both are free, each can move to the other, so they are strongly connected. So each free component forms an SCC (maybe multiple SCCs if there are free cells adjacent to non-free cells? But free cells adjacent to each other are mutually reachable, so they are in same SCC). So SCCs of free cells are just connected components of free cells (undirected). Because any edge between free cells is bidirectional, making them strongly connected. So each free component is an SCC.\n\n- For each free component, there may be outgoing edges to adjacent non-free empty cells (i.e., '.' cells that have at least one adjacent #). Those non-free cells have out-degree 0, so they are sink SCCs of size 1.\n\nThus condensation DAG is a bipartite: each free component points to some sink non-free cells (maybe multiple). No edges between non-free cells (since they have out-degree 0). No edges from non-free to anything. No edges from free component to another free component (since they would be connected via free cells, thus same component). So DAG is simple: each free component has edges to some sink nodes.\n\nTherefore reachable set from any node:\n- If node is non-free: size =1.\n- If node is free: reachable = size of its free component + number of distinct non-free neighbor cells adjacent to any cell in that component.\n\nThus we can compute for each free component: its size (count of free cells) and the set of adjacent non-free empty cells (unique). The degree of freedom = component size + count of adjacent non-free cells.\n\nWe need max over all empty cells. For non-free cells, degree =1, which may be max if all components size+adjacent =1.\n\nImplementation steps:\n- Read grid.\n- Determine for each empty cell whether it is free: check its four neighbors for any '#'. If any neighbor is '#', then not free. Edge cells treat out-of-bounds as no magnet (so not counted). So free if all existing orthogonal neighbors are not '#'.\n- Use DSU or BFS to find connected components among free cells (adjacent 4-direction). Use BFS/DFS with visited array.\n- For each component, maintain size and a set (or count) of adjacent non-free empty cells. To avoid storing large sets, we can mark each non-free cell and count unique per component. Since each non-free cell may be adjacent to multiple free cells within same component, we need to ensure counted once. Approach: during BFS of component, for each neighbor cell that is empty ('.') but not free, we can add its index to a set (e.g., Python set) for that component. Component size up to 1e6, but total non-free cells also up to 1e6, sets overall memory okay. However worst-case each component could be large and have many adjacent non-free cells, but total adjacency edges is O(N). So using set per component is okay.\n\nAlternative: assign each non-free cell an id, and during BFS we can add to a list and later deduplicate via a global visited timestamp array per component. Use a global array 'last_seen' of size N to store component id when counted. For each component, we increment component id, and when encountering a non-free neighbor cell, if last_seen[idx] != comp_id, then increment count and set last_seen[idx]=comp_id. This avoids per-component set overhead.\n\nWe'll implement using 1D index = i*W + j.\n\nAlgorithm:\n- Parse grid into list of strings.\n- Create boolean arrays: is_empty (grid[i][j]=='.'), is_free (empty and no adjacent '#').\n- visited_free = boolean array.\n- last_seen = array of ints initialized 0, size N.\n- comp_id = 1.. etc.\n- max_degree = 1 (since at least one empty cell).\n- For each cell that is empty and free and not visited:\n    - BFS queue.\n    - comp_size =0\n    - adj_nonfree =0\n    - while queue:\n        - pop cell.\n        - comp_size+=1\n        - for each 4 neighbor:\n            - if inside grid:\n                - if grid[ni][nj]=='#': continue (but free condition already ensures none)\n                - if is_empty:\n                    - if is_free and not visited: add to queue, visited.\n                    - else (non-free): idx = ni*W+nj; if last_seen[idx]!=comp_id: last_seen[idx]=comp_id; adj_nonfree+=1\n    - degree = comp_size + adj_nonfree\n    - max_degree = max(max_degree, degree)\n- After processing all free components, also consider non-free empty cells: degree=1, but max already at least 1.\n\nEdge Cases: isolated free cell with no adjacent non-free cells: degree =1 (size 1 + 0).

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm outputs the maximum degree of freedom.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nA blocked empty cell cannot move to any other cell.\n\n**Proof.** By definition a blocked cell has at least one adjacent `#`.\nThe movement rule forbids any move from such a cell. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nAll free cells that are 4‑connected belong to the same SCC of the directed\ngraph.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf two free cells `a` and `b` are neighbours, the movement rule allows a move\n`a → b` (source `a` is free) and also `b → a` (source `b` is free).  \nThus every edge between neighbouring free cells is bidirectional.\nConsequently any two free cells that are connected by a path of neighbour\nsteps have directed paths in both directions, i.e. they are mutually reachable\nand belong to the same SCC. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a free component `C` let `B(C)` be the set of blocked empty cells that are\nadjacent to at least one cell of `C`.  \nFor every cell `v ∈ C` the set of cells reachable from `v` is exactly\n`C ∪ B(C)`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Containment*  \n* Inside `C` we can move freely because every step starts from a free cell,\n  therefore all cells of `C` are reachable.\n* From any cell of `C` we may step to a neighbour that is blocked (it is\n  allowed because the source is free). Hence every cell of `B(C)` is reachable.\n\n*No other cells*  \nConsider any reachable cell `x` that is not in `C`.  \nThe first step that leaves `C` must go from a free cell (still inside `C`) to\na neighbour `y`. By the movement rule `y` must be empty; if `y` were free,\nit would belong to `C` (Lemma&nbsp;2), contradicting that `x ∉ C`.  \nThus `y` is blocked, and because blocked cells have out‑degree 0\n(Lemma&nbsp;1) the walk stops at `y`. Therefore `x` is a blocked neighbour of\n`C`, i.e. `x ∈ B(C)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm computes for each free component `C` the value\n`|C| + |B(C)|`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nDuring BFS of `C` the algorithm\n\n* counts every visited free cell – exactly `|C|`;\n* examines all four neighbours of each visited cell.\n  Whenever a neighbour is a blocked empty cell, its linear index `idx` is\n  considered. The array `last_seen` guarantees that this neighbour contributes\n  at most once to `adj_cnt`. Hence `adj_cnt` equals the number of distinct\n  blocked neighbours, i.e. `|B(C)|`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nFor every empty cell `v` the algorithm records a degree of freedom equal to\nthe true number of cells reachable from `v`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If `v` is blocked*: the algorithm never puts it into a free component,\nso the global maximum is compared with `1`. By Lemma&nbsp;1 the reachable set\nis `{v}`, size `1`.  \n\n*If `v` is free*: `v` belongs to a unique free component `C`.  \nThe algorithm computes `|C| + |B(C)|` for `C` (Lemma&nbsp;4) and uses this\nvalue for all its cells. By Lemma&nbsp;3 this is exactly the size of the\nreachable set from `v`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 6  \nThe value printed by the algorithm equals the maximum degree of freedom over\nall empty cells.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFrom Lemma&nbsp;5 the algorithm evaluates the correct degree for every empty\ncell (either `1` or the component value). The variable `ans` is updated with\nthe maximum of all those values, therefore after processing the whole grid\n`ans` equals the desired maximum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`solve()` prints the correct answer for the given problem.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;6 the algorithm outputs the maximum degree of freedom among all\nempty cells, which is exactly the quantity required by the problem\nstatement. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Strength of a subarray of length x is defined as sum_{i=1..x} (-1)^{i+1} * sum[i] * (x - i + 1), where sum[i] is sum of first i elements of that subarray? Wait: \"sum[i] is the sum of elements in the subarray that is i^th according to the pattern\". Probably sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements of the subarray (prefix sum). Let's test with example1: subarray [1,2,3] length 3. Prefix sums: sum1=1, sum2=3, sum3=6. Strength = sum1*3 - sum2*2 + sum3*1 = 1*3 -3*2 +6*1 =3-6+6=3. But they said total strength of three subarrays: (1+2+3)*3 - (-1)*2 + 2*1 =? Wait they treat each subarray individually? They selected subarrays: [1,2,3] (len3), [-1] (len1), [2] (len1). Compute strength of each: For [1,2,3] they used (1+2+3)*3 =6*3=18? Actually they wrote (1+2+3)*3 - (-1)*2 + 2*1 = 22. That suggests they treat the whole selection as a combined sequence? Let's compute: For first subarray length3, maybe strength = sum of its elements *3? That's 6*3=18. For second subarray length1, strength = -(-1)*2? Wait they have - (-1) *2 = +2. For third subarray length1, strength = 2*1 =2. Total 18+2+2=22. So they used formula where for each subarray, the coefficient (x - i +1) depends on its position among selected subarrays? Actually they treat sum[i] as sum of i-th selected subarray? Let's reinterpret: We have k subarrays selected, indexed 1..k in order of appearance? Then strength = sum_{i=1..k} (-1)^{i+1} * (sum of elements in i-th subarray) * (k - i +1). That matches example: k=3. Subarray sums: s1=6, s2=-1, s3=2. Compute: i=1: (+) s1 * (3) = 6*3=18. i=2: (-) s2 * (2) = -(-1)*2 = +2. i=3: (+) s3 * (1) = 2*1=2. Total 22. Yes! So the definition earlier with sum[i] being sum of i-th subarray (not prefix within subarray). The earlier description confusing.\n\nThus problem: Choose k disjoint subarrays (order matters as they appear left to right) to maximize total = Σ_{i=1..k} (-1)^{i+1} * S_i * (k - i + 1), where S_i is sum of elements in i-th selected subarray. k is odd positive.\n\nGoal: maximize this value.\n\nWe can think dynamic programming: we need to pick k subarrays, each can be any non-empty contiguous segment, disjoint and in order. Equivalent to partitioning array into up to 2k-1 segments: choose start and end for each subarray, with gaps allowed.\n\nWe need DP over positions and count of subarrays selected, and maybe sign factor.\n\nLet dp[pos][t] = maximum total strength achievable considering prefix up to index pos (0..n), having selected t subarrays, and the last considered position is pos (i.e., we are at boundary after pos). We can either not start a new subarray at pos, or start one that ends later.\n\nStandard DP for selecting subarrays with weights: For each subarray we need its sum multiplied by weight w = (-1)^{i+1} * (k - i +1). Since weight depends on i (order). So when we are selecting the i-th subarray, its contribution = weight_i * sum(subarray). weight_i = ((-1)^{i+1}) * (k - i +1). Since k is fixed, we can precompute weights for i=1..k.\n\nThus we need to select k subarrays with these weights.\n\nWe can treat each subarray selection as we add weight_i * sum. So DP: dp[i][j] = max total after processing first i elements (0-indexed, i elements considered) and having selected j subarrays, and we are not inside a subarray (i.e., last position is a boundary). Transition: either skip element i (dp[i+1][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j])) or start a new subarray at i, choose end at e (>=i) and add weight_{j+1} * sum(nums[i:e+1]) then continue from e+1 with j+1 subarrays.\n\nNaively O(n^2 k). n up to 1e4, k up to n, but n*k <=1e6, so O(n^2) too big. Need O(nk) using Kadane-like DP for max subarray sum with weight.\n\nObservation: For each j, we need to compute best value of dp[i][j] where we may start a subarray at i. Equivalent to compute best of dp[i][j] - weight_{j+1} * prefix_sum_before_start? Let's define prefix sums P[0]=0, P[t]=sum_{0..t-1} nums.\n\nSum of subarray [l, r] = P[r+1] - P[l].\n\nContribution = weight * (P[r+1] - P[l]) = weight*P[r+1] - weight*P[l].\n\nThus transition: dp[r+1][j+1] = max over l <= r of (dp[l][j] + weight_{j+1} * (P[r+1] - P[l])) = weight_{j+1}*P[r+1] + max_{l} (dp[l][j] - weight_{j+1}*P[l]).\n\nThus we can maintain best value best_j = max_{l} (dp[l][j] - weight_{j+1}*P[l]) as we iterate r from 0..n-1.\n\nWe also need to allow skipping elements: dp[i+1][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j]) (since we can not start subarray at i). This ensures dp is non-decreasing over i.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\nInitialize dp0 array of size (k+1) with -inf, dp0[0]=0. We'll iterate over positions i from 0..n (prefix length). We'll maintain dp[j] for current position i (i.e., after processing first i elements). We'll also maintain best[j] for each j (0..k-1) representing max(dp[l][j] - weight_{j+1}*P[l]) seen so far for l up to current i.\n\nInitialize best[j] = -inf.\n\nIterate i from 0 to n-1:\n    # first, we can update dp for ending subarray at i (i.e., r = i)\n    for j from 0 to k-1:\n        if best[j] != -inf:\n            candidate = best[j] + weight_{j+1} * P[i+1]   # because r=i, P[r+1]\n            dp_next_j1 = max(dp_next[j+1], candidate)\n    # also propagate dp without taking new subarray: dp_next[j] = max(dp_next[j], dp[j])\n    # after processing position i, we need to update best for future ends using dp at position i+1? Actually best uses dp[l][j] where l is start index (prefix length before subarray). l can be any position up to current i (including i+1 after we have processed element i). Since we will consider subarrays that start at l and end later. So after we have dp for position i+1 (i.e., after processing element i), we can update best[j] with dp[i+1][j] - weight_{j+1}*P[i+1].\n\nThus we need to keep dp array for each position iteratively.\n\nImplementation details:\n\nInitialize dp = [-inf]*(k+1); dp[0]=0\nInitialize best = [-inf]*k  # for j from 0..k-1 (since weight index j+1)\nInitialize prefix sum P = 0\n\nLoop over idx from 0 to n-1:\n    P += nums[idx]   # now P = prefix sum up to idx+1\n    # first, consider ending subarray at idx using best values from previous positions (which are based on dp up to start positions before idx+1)\n    new_dp = dp[:]   # copy for updates? We'll compute updates in place but careful order: we need to use previous dp and best to compute candidate for dp[j+1] at this position. Since dp[j+1] may also be updated earlier in this iteration from other j? That's okay because each candidate uses best[j] which is based on dp up to earlier positions (including possibly dp at same idx? but start cannot be after end). Since best[j] hasn't been updated with dp at current position yet (we will update after). So we can compute candidates and store in new_dp.\n\n    for j in range(k):\n        if best[j] != -inf:\n            cand = best[j] + weights[j] * P   # weights indexed j (j corresponds to subarray number j+1)\n            if cand > new_dp[j+1]:\n                new_dp[j+1] = cand\n    # also propagate dp (skip) already in new_dp as copy.\n    dp = new_dp\n    # now update best for each j using dp at position idx+1 (current prefix)\n    for j in range(k):\n        # dp[j] corresponds to having selected j subarrays up to this prefix\n        val = dp[j] - weights[j] * P if j < k else None\n        # Wait weight for j subarrays? For future subarray number j+1, weight = weights[j] (0-index). So best[j] = max(dp[l][j] - weight_{j+1}*P[l]).\n        # So we need weight_{j+1} = weights[j]\n        if j < k:\n            cur = dp[j] - weights[j] * P\n            if cur > best[j]:\n                best[j] = cur\n\nEdge Cases: weights array length k, weights[i] = ((-1)^{i+1}) * (k - i). Wait i from 0..k-1 corresponds to subarray number i+1. weight = (-1)^{(i+1)+1}? Actually formula: (-1)^{i+1} * (k - i +1). For i=1 => (-1)^{2}=+1 * (k) . For i=2 => (-1)^{3}=-1 * (k-1). So weight_i = ((-1)^{i+1}) * (k - i +1). Let's compute for i=1..k. In zero-index j = i-1: weight_j = ((-1)^{(j+1)+1}) * (k - (j+1) +1) = (-1)^{j+2} * (k - j). Since (-1)^{j+2}=(-1)^j (because even shift). So weight_j = (-1)^j * (k - j). Example k=3: weights: j=0: (-1)^0 * (3) = 3. j=1: (-1)^1 * (2) = -2. j=2: (-1)^2 * (1) = 1. Matches example.\n\nThus compute weights list.\n\nComplexities: O(nk) loops: each iteration we loop over j up to k (max 1e4) and n up to 1e4, but n*k <=1e6, so okay.\n\nNeed to handle -inf large negative: use -10**30.\n\nReturn dp[k] after processing all positions.\n\nTest with examples.\n\nLet's simulate quickly in mind.\n\nEdge: k odd but not needed.\n\nImplementation details: function signature: def max_strength(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n\nReturn int.\n\nLet's produce final code.", "signature": null, "redacted": false}, {"internal": null, "type": "text", "text": "```python\ndef max_strength(nums, k):\n    INF_NEG = -10**30\n    n = len(nums)\n\n    # pre‑compute weights for subarray 1..k\n    # weight_j corresponds to the (j+1)-th selected subarray (0‑based index j)\n    weights = [(( -1) ** j) * (k - j) for j in range(k)]\n\n    # dp[t] = best total strength after processing current prefix,\n    #         having selected exactly t subarrays (t from 0..k)\n    dp = [INF_NEG] * (k + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n\n    # best[t] = max_{l <= current prefix} ( dp[l][t] - weight_{t+1} * prefix_sum[l] )\n    # for t = 0..k-1 (since we need it when we are about to add the (t+1)-th subarray)\n    best = [INF_NEG] * k\n\n    prefix = 0\n    for x in nums:\n        prefix += x\n\n        # try to finish a subarray at the current position\n        new_dp = dp[:]                     # copy to avoid interfering updates\n        for t in range(k):                # t = number of subarrays already taken\n            if best[t] != INF_NEG:\n                cand = best[t] + weights[t] * prefix\n                if cand > new_dp[t + 1]:\n                    new_dp[t + 1] = cand\n        dp = new_dp\n\n        # update best[] with the state after this prefix (may start next subarray later)\n        for t in range(k):\n            cur = dp[t] - weights[t] * prefix\n            if cur > best[t]:\n                best[t] = cur\n\n    return dp[k]\n```", "refusal": null}], "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "gpt-oss-120b"}, "stop_reason": "stop", "logprobs": null}], "usage": {"input_tokens": 801, "output_tokens": 3115, "total_tokens": 3916, "input_tokens_cache_write": null, "input_tokens_cache_read": null, "reasoning_tokens": null}, "time": null, "metadata": null, "error": null}, "messages": [{"id": "267e2dde", "content": [{"internal": null, "type": "reasoning", "reasoning": "We need to parse the problem: Given array nums length n, need to select k disjoint subarrays (contiguous segments) to maximize total \"strength\".

We'll also maintain best[j] for each j (0..k-1) representing max(dp[l][j] - weight_{j+1}*P[l]) seen so far for l up to current i.\n\nInitialize best[j] = -inf.\n\nIterate i from 0 to n-1:\n    # first, we can update dp for ending subarray at i (i.e., r = i)\n    for j from 0 to k-1:\n        if best[j] != -inf:\n            candidate = best[j] + weight_{j+1} * P[i+1]   # because r=i, P[r+1]\n            dp_next_j1 = max(dp_next[j+1], candidate)\n    # also propagate dp without taking new subarray: dp_next[j] = max(dp_next[j], dp[j])\n    # after processing position i, we need to update best for future ends using dp at position i+1? Actually best uses dp[l][j] where l is start index (prefix length before subarray). l can be any position up to current i (including i+1 after we have processed element i). Since we will consider subarrays that start at l and end later. So after we have dp for position i+1 (i.e., after processing element i), we can update best[j] with dp[i+1][j] - weight_{j+1}*P[i+1].\n\nThus we need to keep dp array for each position iteratively.\n\nImplementation details:\n\nInitialize dp = [-inf]*(k+1); dp[0]=0\nInitialize best = [-inf]*k  # for j from 0..k-1 (since weight index j+1)\nInitialize prefix sum P = 0\n\nLoop over idx from 0 to n-1:\n    P += nums[idx]   # now P = prefix sum up to idx+1\n    # first, consider ending subarray at idx using best values from previous positions (which are based on dp up to start positions before idx+1)\n    new_dp = dp[:]   # copy for updates? We'll compute updates in place but careful order: we need to use previous dp and best to compute candidate for dp[j+1] at this position. Since dp[j+1] may also be updated earlier in this iteration from other j? That's okay because each candidate uses best[j] which is based on dp up to earlier positions (including possibly dp at same idx? but start cannot be after end). Since best[j] hasn't been updated with dp at current position yet (we will update after). So we can compute candidates and store in new_dp.\n\n    for j in range(k):\n        if best[j] != -inf:\n            cand = best[j] + weights[j] * P   # weights indexed j (j corresponds to subarray number j+1)\n            if cand > new_dp[j+1]:\n                new_dp[j+1] = cand\n    # also propagate dp (skip) already in new_dp as copy.\n    dp = new_dp\n    # now update best for each j using dp at position idx+1 (current prefix)\n    for j in range(k):\n        # dp[j] corresponds to having selected j subarrays up to this prefix\n        val = dp[j] - weights[j] * P if j < k else None\n        # Wait weight for j subarrays? For future subarray number j+1, weight = weights[j] (0-index). So best[j] = max(dp[l][j] - weight_{j+1}*P[l]).\n        # So we need weight_{j+1} = weights[j]\n        if j < k:\n            cur = dp[j] - weights[j] * P\n            if cur > best[j]:\n                best[j] = cur\n\nEdge Cases: weights array length k, weights[i] = ((-1)^{i+1}) * (k - i). Wait i from 0..k-1 corresponds to subarray number i+1. weight = (-1)^{(i+1)+1}? Actually formula: (-1)^{i+1} * (k - i +1). For i=1 => (-1)^{2}=+1 * (k) . For i=2 => (-1)^{3}=-1 * (k-1). So weight_i = ((-1)^{i+1}) * (k - i +1). Let's compute for i=1..k. In zero-index j = i-1: weight_j = ((-1)^{(j+1)+1}) * (k - (j+1) +1) = (-1)^{j+2} * (k - j). Since (-1)^{j+2}=(-1)^j (because even shift). So weight_j = (-1)^j * (k - j). Example k=3: weights: j=0: (-1)^0 * (3) = 3. j=1: (-1)^1 * (2) = -2. j=2: (-1)^2 * (1) = 1.

We can delete any characters (any occurrences). We cannot add. Want minimal deletions.\n\nWe need to compute minimal deletions to achieve that condition.\n\nWe have up to 1e5 length, 26 letters only. So we can count frequencies of each letter (0-26). Let freq array of size 26.\n\nGoal: choose target frequencies for each letter (maybe zero if we delete all of that letter) such that for any two letters with non-zero final freq, max - min <= k. Min deletions = sum over letters of (original freq - target freq). Since deletions only reduce frequencies.\n\nWe need to find optimal set of final frequencies (non-negative integers <= original freq) satisfying condition.\n\nObservation: Since only relative differences matter, we can think of choosing a range [L, R] where R - L <= k, and for each letter we can keep at most its original freq, but also we can reduce it to any value within [L, R] (or zero if we delete all). However, if we keep a letter, its final freq must be within [L,R]. Also we could delete all occurrences (freq=0) which is allowed regardless of range? The condition is for all i,j indices in the string after deletions. If a character is absent, it's not considered? The definition: word is k-special if |freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| <= k for all indices i and j in the string. If a character doesn't appear, there is no i with that character, so it's irrelevant. So we can drop letters entirely.\n\nThus we need to choose L,R (L>=1 maybe) such that R-L <= k, and for each letter we either delete all (target 0) or keep some count between L and R (inclusive) not exceeding original freq. To minimize deletions, for each letter we would keep as many as possible within the allowed range: i.e., target = min(original freq, R) but also must be >= L if we keep it. If original freq < L, we cannot keep any because we can't increase; so we must delete all (target 0). If original freq >= L, we can keep any value between L and min(original freq,R). To minimize deletions, we keep the max possible, i.e., min(original freq,R). So deletions for that letter = original freq - min(original freq,R) = max(0, original freq - R). If original freq < L, we could also keep original freq (which is <L) but then the min freq among kept letters would be <L, violating range? Actually the condition requires max-min <= k. If we keep a letter with freq < L, then the min would be lower than L, making range maybe larger. But we could adjust L to be that lower value. So the concept of L,R is just the min and max among kept frequencies. So we can think of selecting a set of letters to keep, and their final frequencies will be some values between 1 and original freq, and the max-min <= k. To minimize deletions, we would keep each kept letter at its original freq (no deletions) unless that would violate the max-min constraint. So we need to possibly reduce some high frequencies down to bring them within k of the lowest kept frequency.\n\nThus we can think of sorting the original frequencies (non-zero). Let arr sorted ascending. We need to choose a subsequence (maybe all) where after possibly reducing some high values down to at most low + k, we minimize deletions. For a given low = arr[i] (the minimal frequency among kept letters after deletions), we can keep any letter with original freq <= low + k fully (no deletions). For letters with original freq > low + k, we need to reduce them down to low + k (deleting excess). So deletions = sum_{freq > low + k} (freq - (low + k)). Also we could choose to drop some letters entirely (i.e., delete all occurrences) if that yields fewer deletions than reducing them to low + k? For a letter with freq > low + k, we have two options: reduce to low + k (cost = freq - (low + k)) or delete all (cost = freq). Since low + k >= low >=1, reducing cost is less than deleting all, so better to reduce. For letters with freq < low, we cannot increase them, so they must be deleted entirely (cost = freq). So we need to consider low being any possible target minimal frequency among kept letters (could be 0? If we delete all letters, deletions = total length, but we can do better). So we iterate over possible low values among the distinct frequencies (including maybe 0). For each low, compute deletions = sum_{freq < low} freq + sum_{freq > low + k} (freq - (low + k)). The letters with freq in [low, low+k] are kept fully.\n\nGoal: minimize deletions.\n\nWe can precompute prefix sums of sorted frequencies to compute sums quickly.\n\nLet frequencies list f of length m (non-zero). Sort ascending.\n\nCompute prefix sum pref[i] = sum of f[0..i-1] (size m+1). Also total sum = pref[m].\n\nFor each index i as start of low = f[i] (or we could also consider low values not equal to any freq, but optimal low will be some existing freq or maybe 0). Also consider low = 0 (meaning we can keep any freq up to k? Actually if low=0, then we could keep letters with freq <= k fully, and reduce higher ones to k. But low=0 means we could also delete letters with freq <0 none. But we could also delete all letters with freq <0 none. So low=0 is allowed (meaning we allow min freq 0? But if a letter is kept with freq >0, min freq among kept letters would be >0, not 0. So low=0 would correspond to possibly dropping some letters entirely (those with freq <0 none). Actually low=0 means we are allowed to have min kept frequency as low as 0, but if we keep any letter, its freq must be >=0, which is always true. However the condition max-min <= k would be max <= k. So low=0 corresponds to target max <= k. That's a valid scenario: we could keep letters with freq <= k fully, and reduce higher ones to k. So we should consider low = 0 as a candidate.\n\nThus we can consider low values being 0 and each distinct freq.\n\nImplementation: For each low candidate, find index lo = first index where f[idx] >= low (i.e., using binary search). Since low is either 0 or some f[i], lo = i for low = f[i] (since sorted). For low=0, lo=0.\n\nSum of frequencies less than low = pref[lo].\n\nNow need to find index hi = first index where f[idx] > low + k (i.e., upper bound). Then sum of frequencies > low + k = total - pref[hi]. For those, deletions = sum_{>low+k} (freq - (low+k)) = (total - pref[hi]) - (m - hi)*(low + k).\n\nTotal deletions = pref[lo] + (total - pref[hi]) - (m - hi)*(low + k).\n\nWe need to compute minimal over candidates.\n\nComplexities O(m log m). m <= 26, trivial.\n\nEdge cases: If we delete all letters, deletions = total length. Our formula with low maybe > max freq leads to pref[lo]=total, hi=m, second term zero, deletions = total.

We can delete any characters (any occurrences). We cannot add. Want minimal deletions.\n\nWe need to compute minimal deletions to achieve that condition.\n\nWe have up to 1e5 length, 26 letters only. So we can count frequencies of each letter (0-26). Let freq array of size 26.\n\nGoal: choose target frequencies for each letter (maybe zero if we delete all of that letter) such that for any two letters with non-zero final freq, max - min <= k. Min deletions = sum over letters of (original freq - target freq). Since deletions only reduce frequencies.\n\nWe need to find optimal set of final frequencies (non-negative integers <= original freq) satisfying condition.\n\nObservation: Since only relative differences matter, we can think of choosing a range [L, R] where R - L <= k, and for each letter we can keep at most its original freq, but also we can reduce it to any value within [L, R] (or zero if we delete all). However, if we keep a letter, its final freq must be within [L,R]. Also we could delete all occurrences (freq=0) which is allowed regardless of range? The condition is for all i,j indices in the string after deletions. If a character is absent, it's not considered? The definition: word is k-special if |freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| <= k for all indices i and j in the string. If a character doesn't appear, there is no i with that character, so it's irrelevant. So we can drop letters entirely.\n\nThus we need to choose L,R (L>=1 maybe) such that R-L <= k, and for each letter we either delete all (target 0) or keep some count between L and R (inclusive) not exceeding original freq. To minimize deletions, for each letter we would keep as many as possible within the allowed range: i.e., target = min(original freq, R) but also must be >= L if we keep it. If original freq < L, we cannot keep any because we can't increase; so we must delete all (target 0). If original freq >= L, we can keep any value between L and min(original freq,R). To minimize deletions, we keep the max possible, i.e., min(original freq,R). So deletions for that letter = original freq - min(original freq,R) = max(0, original freq - R). If original freq < L, we could also keep original freq (which is <L) but then the min freq among kept letters would be <L, violating range? Actually the condition requires max-min <= k. If we keep a letter with freq < L, then the min would be lower than L, making range maybe larger. But we could adjust L to be that lower value. So the concept of L,R is just the min and max among kept frequencies. So we can think of selecting a set of letters to keep, and their final frequencies will be some values between 1 and original freq, and the max-min <= k. To minimize deletions, we would keep each kept letter at its original freq (no deletions) unless that would violate the max-min constraint. So we need to possibly reduce some high frequencies down to bring them within k of the lowest kept frequency.\n\nThus we can think of sorting the original frequencies (non-zero). Let arr sorted ascending. We need to choose a subsequence (maybe all) where after possibly reducing some high values down to at most low + k, we minimize deletions. For a given low = arr[i] (the minimal frequency among kept letters after deletions), we can keep any letter with original freq <= low + k fully (no deletions). For letters with original freq > low + k, we need to reduce them down to low + k (deleting excess). So deletions = sum_{freq > low + k} (freq - (low + k)). Also we could choose to drop some letters entirely (i.e., delete all occurrences) if that yields fewer deletions than reducing them to low + k? For a letter with freq > low + k, we have two options: reduce to low + k (cost = freq - (low + k)) or delete all (cost = freq). Since low + k >= low >=1, reducing cost is less than deleting all, so better to reduce. For letters with freq < low, we cannot increase them, so they must be deleted entirely (cost = freq). So we need to consider low being any possible target minimal frequency among kept letters (could be 0? If we delete all letters, deletions = total length, but we can do better). So we iterate over possible low values among the distinct frequencies (including maybe 0). For each low, compute deletions = sum_{freq < low} freq + sum_{freq > low + k} (freq - (low + k)). The letters with freq in [low, low+k] are kept fully.\n\nGoal: minimize deletions.\n\nWe can precompute prefix sums of sorted frequencies to compute sums quickly.\n\nLet frequencies list f of length m (non-zero). Sort ascending.\n\nCompute prefix sum pref[i] = sum of f[0..i-1] (size m+1). Also total sum = pref[m].\n\nFor each index i as start of low = f[i] (or we could also consider low values not equal to any freq, but optimal low will be some existing freq or maybe 0). Also consider low = 0 (meaning we can keep any freq up to k? Actually if low=0, then we could keep letters with freq <= k fully, and reduce higher ones to k. But low=0 means we could also delete letters with freq <0 none. But we could also delete all letters with freq <0 none. So low=0 is allowed (meaning we allow min freq 0? But if a letter is kept with freq >0, min freq among kept letters would be >0, not 0. So low=0 would correspond to possibly dropping some letters entirely (those with freq <0 none). Actually low=0 means we are allowed to have min kept frequency as low as 0, but if we keep any letter, its freq must be >=0, which is always true. However the condition max-min <= k would be max <= k. So low=0 corresponds to target max <= k. That's a valid scenario: we could keep letters with freq <= k fully, and reduce higher ones to k. So we should consider low = 0 as a candidate.\n\nThus we can consider low values being 0 and each distinct freq.\n\nImplementation: For each low candidate, find index lo = first index where f[idx] >= low (i.e., using binary search). Since low is either 0 or some f[i], lo = i for low = f[i] (since sorted). For low=0, lo=0.\n\nSum of frequencies less than low = pref[lo].\n\nNow need to find index hi = first index where f[idx] > low + k (i.e., upper bound). Then sum of frequencies > low + k = total - pref[hi]. For those, deletions = sum_{>low+k} (freq - (low+k)) = (total - pref[hi]) - (m - hi)*(low + k).\n\nTotal deletions = pref[lo] + (total - pref[hi]) - (m - hi)*(low + k).\n\nWe need to compute minimal over candidates.\n\nComplexities O(m log m). m <= 26, trivial.\n\nEdge cases: If we delete all letters, deletions = total length.

Alice can start at any index. She can initially collect if that index has 1 (no move). Then she can perform moves: type1: flip a zero to one at any other index (maxChanges total). type2: swap a 1 at x with 0 at adjacent y, moving the 1 towards her position; if y is her current index, she collects that 1 (and that position becomes 0). She can repeat moves unlimited.\n\nEssentially, we need to bring 1s to her position using adjacent swaps, possibly creating new 1s via type1 to serve as sources.\n\nGoal: collect k units with minimal moves. Moves count includes both type1 and type2 operations. Initial collection (if starting on 1) is free (no move). She can start anywhere.\n\nObservation: The process is similar to moving tokens (1s) along line to a target position (aliceIndex). Each token at distance d requires d type2 moves to bring to target (by successive swaps). Additionally, we may need to create new tokens via type1 at some positions (cost 1 each) to have enough tokens to collect.\n\nWe can think of picking a target position p (aliceIndex). She will collect tokens that arrive at p. Initially, if nums[p]==1, she gets one for free. Then we need to bring additional (k - initial) tokens to p. We have existing 1s at positions i != p. For each such 1, distance = |i - p|, cost = distance moves (type2). Also we can create new 1s at any zero position (cost 1 type1) and then move them to p (cost distance). So total cost for a created token at position j is 1 + |j - p|.\n\nWe have limit maxChanges on number of type1 operations (creation). So we can create at most maxChanges tokens.\n\nGoal: choose p and select a multiset of tokens (existing ones and possibly created ones) to collect exactly k tokens minimizing total moves, with at most maxChanges creations.\n\nWe can treat each existing 1 as token with cost = distance, creation token as cost = 1 + distance, but we can choose any zero position for creation; obviously we would choose zeros closest to p to minimize distance. So for a given p, we can sort distances of existing 1s, and also distances of zeros (for potential creation). For each zero, cost = 1 + distance.\n\nWe need to pick k tokens with minimal total cost, but we must respect that we can only pick at most maxChanges zero-based tokens (creations). Also we cannot pick more tokens than available (existing 1s + zeros). Since maxChanges + sum(nums) >= k, feasible.\n\nThus for each p, we can compute sorted list of costs for existing 1s (distances) and for zeros (1+distance). Then we need to pick k smallest costs, but with at most maxChanges from zero list.\n\nThis is like merging two sorted lists with a constraint.\n\nWe need to compute minimal total cost across all p (0..n-1). n up to 1e5, need O(n log n) maybe.\n\nWe can precompute distances? For each p, distances to all positions are |i-p|. That's O(n^2) naive.\n\nWe need smarter: Since cost depends on distance, we can think of moving outward from p, collecting tokens as we expand radius r. At distance d, there are positions p-d and p+d (if within bounds). For each such position, if it's a 1, we have token cost d (no creation). If it's 0, we could create token cost 1+d (if we have creation budget). So as we expand radius, we encounter tokens with incremental cost.\n\nThus we can simulate for each p expanding outward until we collect k tokens. That's O(n*k) worst.\n\nNeed better: maybe we can compute minimal moves using sliding window? Observing that moving tokens from left and right is independent.\n\nAlternative: Since we can start at any p, maybe optimal p is median of selected tokens? Not sure.\n\nBut constraints up to 1e5, we could try O(n log n) using priority queue while sweeping p? Might be complex.\n\nSimplify: Since maxChanges can be up to 1e5, we could treat creation as just adding cost 1 to distance. So effectively we have two types of tokens with base distance d, and extra +1 if created.\n\nThus for each p, we need to pick k smallest values among two multisets: distances of existing 1s, and distances+1 of zeros (with limit). This is similar to picking k smallest distances, but we can optionally add +1 to some of them (up to maxChanges) to represent using a zero.\n\nObservation: For any position, using a zero at distance d costs d+1, which is always >= cost of using an existing 1 at same distance (d). So we would only use zeros when we run out of existing 1s within needed radius. So optimal selection: take all existing 1s sorted by distance, then if need more, take zeros sorted by distance (cost d+1). So we just need to know for each p, the distances of existing 1s sorted, and count of zeros at each distance.\n\nThus total cost = sum of smallest k distances among existing 1s, plus for any remaining needed tokens, sum of (distance+1) for nearest zeros.\n\nImplementation: For each p, we can compute prefix sums of distances of existing 1s sorted by distance. But distances depend on p.\n\nHowever, we can precompute positions of 1s and zeros. For a given p, distances to 1s are |pos - p|. The sorted distances are just the absolute differences. The sum of smallest t distances can be computed using order statistics? This is like we need sum of t smallest absolute differences between p and a set of points (positions of 1s). This can be computed using prefix sums of positions sorted globally, using binary search to find how many 1s on left/right within certain radius.\n\nWe can binary search radius r such that number of 1s within distance r (including at distance 0) is at least t. Then sum of distances of those within r can be computed using prefix sums of positions.\n\nSimilarly for zeros.\n\nThus for each p, we can compute minimal moves as: we need k tokens. Let cnt1 = number of 1s (including possibly at p). If cnt1 >= k, we just need sum of k smallest distances among 1s. Else need extra = k - cnt1, we will take all 1s distances sum, plus sum of extra smallest distances among zeros plus extra (the +1 each). So total = sumDist1_all + sumDistZeros_extra + extra*1.\n\nBut we may not need all 1s; we might not need to bring far 1s if zeros closer? Wait zeros cost distance+1, which is always >= distance of a 1 at same distance. So any zero at distance d is never better than a 1 at same distance. So we will always prefer all available 1s before any zero. So indeed we take all 1s (maybe not all if more than k). If more than k, we only take k nearest 1s.\n\nThus algorithm: For each p, compute distances to 1s sorted; take up to k nearest. If number of 1s >= k, total cost = sum of k nearest distances. Else total cost = sum of all distances of 1s + (k - cnt1) * 1 + sum of (k - cnt1) nearest distances among zeros.\n\nThus we need ability to compute sum of smallest t distances to 1s and zeros for each p efficiently.\n\nWe can precompute prefix sums of positions of 1s (sorted) and zeros.\n\nGiven p, distances to left side positions L (pos < p) are p - pos. To right side R (pos > p) are pos - p.\n\nIf we want sum of smallest t distances, we can think of expanding radius r until we have at least t points. The sum of distances of points within radius r is: for left side positions >= p - r, sum (p - pos) = count_left * p - sum_left_positions. Similarly right side sum = sum_right_positions - count_right * p.\n\nIf we have more than t points within radius r, we need to subtract excess farthest distances. That can be handled by taking exactly t points: we can compute number of points on left and right within radius r, then if total > t, we need to remove some farthest points (which are at distance r). Since points at exact distance r may be on both sides. Simpler: we can binary search radius r to get at least t points, then compute sum of distances of all points within radius r, then subtract (total - t) * r (since the extra points are at distance exactly r). This works because all points within radius r have distance <= r, and the farthest among them are at distance r. However there could be points with distance < r that we might need to drop if extra > number at distance r. But we can treat as we drop some points at distance r (the farthest). Since we only know count at distance exactly r maybe multiple. This works if we assume we can drop any of the points at distance r, which is fine because they all have same distance r.\n\nThus we need ability to count number of points with distance <= r: count = left_count + right_count where left positions >= p - r, right positions <= p + r.\n\nWe also need sum of positions of those points to compute sum distances.\n\nWe can precompute prefix sums of positions for 1s and zeros arrays.\n\nImplementation steps for a given p and t (t <= total points of that type):\n\nDefine arrays pos1 sorted, pref1 prefix sums.\n\nFunction sum_nearest(pos_array, pref, p, t):\n    if t == 0: return 0\n    # binary search radius r in [0, max(p, n-1-p)] maybe up to n.\n    lo=0, hi=n\n    while lo<hi:\n        mid=(lo+hi)//2\n        cnt = count points within distance mid.\n        if cnt >= t: hi=mid else lo=mid+1\n    r=lo\n    # compute cnt and sumDist for radius r\n    left_idx = lower_bound(pos_array, p - r)  # first >= p - r\n    right_idx = upper_bound(pos_array, p + r) -1  # last <= p + r\n    cnt = (len - left_idx)?? Actually count = (right_idx - left_idx +1)\n    sumPos = pref[right_idx+1] - pref[left_idx]\n    # sum distances = cnt * p - sum of left positions (those <= p) + sum of right positions - cnt_right * p\n    But we need split left/right.\n    left_end = upper_bound(pos_array, p) -1\n    left_count = max(0, left_end - left_idx +1)\n    left_sum = pref[left_end+1] - pref[left_idx] if left_count>0 else 0\n    right_start = max(p+1, p - r)?? Actually right side positions > p.\n    right_start = max(p+1, left_idx)?? Better compute right_start = max(p+1, left_idx) but need index of first > p.\n    right_start = upper_bound(pos_array, p)\n    right_count = max(0, right_idx - right_start +1)\n    right_sum = pref[right_idx+1] - pref[right_start] if right_count>0 else 0\n    sumDist = left_count * p - left_sum + right_sum - right_count * p\n    # we have cnt points, maybe > t, extra = cnt - t, subtract extra * r\n    sumDist -= (cnt - t) * r\n    return sumDist\n\nNeed binary search count function: count within distance d = number of positions in [p-d, p+d] = upper_bound(p+d) - lower_bound(p-d).\n\nComplexities O(log n) per query.\n\nNow overall algorithm: iterate p from 0..n-1, compute cnt1_total = total number of 1s. For each p, we need t = min(k, cnt1_total) maybe but we need to consider zeros if cnt1_total < k.\n\nLet totalOnes = len(pos1). For each p:\n    if totalOnes >= k:\n        cost = sum_nearest(pos1, pref1, p, k)\n    else:\n        needZeros = k - totalOnes\n        sumOnes = sum_nearest(pos1, pref1, p, totalOnes)  # all ones\n        sumZeros = sum_nearest(pos0, pref0, p, needZeros)\n        cost = sumOnes + sumZeros + needZeros  # +1 per created token\n    Keep minimal cost.\n\nBut note maxChanges limit: needZeros must be <= maxChanges. If needZeros > maxChanges, then this p is infeasible. Also we could consider using fewer existing ones and more zeros? But zeros are more expensive, so using all ones is optimal as long as maxChanges allows needed zeros. If needZeros > maxChanges, we cannot achieve k tokens from this p. However we could consider using fewer ones? That would increase needZeros, not help. So infeasible.\n\nThus algorithm works.\n\nEdge case: starting position may be a 1, which we counted as distance 0 (cost 0).

Alice can start at any index. She can initially collect if that index has 1 (no move). Then she can perform moves: type1: flip a zero to one at any other index (maxChanges total). type2: swap a 1 at x with 0 at adjacent y, moving the 1 towards her position; if y is her current index, she collects that 1 (and that position becomes 0). She can repeat moves unlimited.\n\nEssentially, we need to bring 1s to her position using adjacent swaps, possibly creating new 1s via type1 to serve as sources.\n\nGoal: collect k units with minimal moves. Moves count includes both type1 and type2 operations. Initial collection (if starting on 1) is free (no move). She can start anywhere.\n\nObservation: The process is similar to moving tokens (1s) along line to a target position (aliceIndex). Each token at distance d requires d type2 moves to bring to target (by successive swaps). Additionally, we may need to create new tokens via type1 at some positions (cost 1 each) to have enough tokens to collect.\n\nWe can think of picking a target position p (aliceIndex). She will collect tokens that arrive at p. Initially, if nums[p]==1, she gets one for free. Then we need to bring additional (k - initial) tokens to p. We have existing 1s at positions i != p. For each such 1, distance = |i - p|, cost = distance moves (type2). Also we can create new 1s at any zero position (cost 1 type1) and then move them to p (cost distance). So total cost for a created token at position j is 1 + |j - p|.\n\nWe have limit maxChanges on number of type1 operations (creation). So we can create at most maxChanges tokens.\n\nGoal: choose p and select a multiset of tokens (existing ones and possibly created ones) to collect exactly k tokens minimizing total moves, with at most maxChanges creations.\n\nWe can treat each existing 1 as token with cost = distance, creation token as cost = 1 + distance, but we can choose any zero position for creation; obviously we would choose zeros closest to p to minimize distance. So for a given p, we can sort distances of existing 1s, and also distances of zeros (for potential creation). For each zero, cost = 1 + distance.\n\nWe need to pick k tokens with minimal total cost, but we must respect that we can only pick at most maxChanges zero-based tokens (creations). Also we cannot pick more tokens than available (existing 1s + zeros). Since maxChanges + sum(nums) >= k, feasible.\n\nThus for each p, we can compute sorted list of costs for existing 1s (distances) and for zeros (1+distance). Then we need to pick k smallest costs, but with at most maxChanges from zero list.\n\nThis is like merging two sorted lists with a constraint.\n\nWe need to compute minimal total cost across all p (0..n-1). n up to 1e5, need O(n log n) maybe.\n\nWe can precompute distances? For each p, distances to all positions are |i-p|. That's O(n^2) naive.\n\nWe need smarter: Since cost depends on distance, we can think of moving outward from p, collecting tokens as we expand radius r. At distance d, there are positions p-d and p+d (if within bounds). For each such position, if it's a 1, we have token cost d (no creation). If it's 0, we could create token cost 1+d (if we have creation budget). So as we expand radius, we encounter tokens with incremental cost.\n\nThus we can simulate for each p expanding outward until we collect k tokens. That's O(n*k) worst.\n\nNeed better: maybe we can compute minimal moves using sliding window? Observing that moving tokens from left and right is independent.\n\nAlternative: Since we can start at any p, maybe optimal p is median of selected tokens? Not sure.\n\nBut constraints up to 1e5, we could try O(n log n) using priority queue while sweeping p? Might be complex.\n\nSimplify: Since maxChanges can be up to 1e5, we could treat creation as just adding cost 1 to distance. So effectively we have two types of tokens with base distance d, and extra +1 if created.\n\nThus for each p, we need to pick k smallest values among two multisets: distances of existing 1s, and distances+1 of zeros (with limit). This is similar to picking k smallest distances, but we can optionally add +1 to some of them (up to maxChanges) to represent using a zero.\n\nObservation: For any position, using a zero at distance d costs d+1, which is always >= cost of using an existing 1 at same distance (d). So we would only use zeros when we run out of existing 1s within needed radius. So optimal selection: take all existing 1s sorted by distance, then if need more, take zeros sorted by distance (cost d+1). So we just need to know for each p, the distances of existing 1s sorted, and count of zeros at each distance.\n\nThus total cost = sum of smallest k distances among existing 1s, plus for any remaining needed tokens, sum of (distance+1) for nearest zeros.\n\nImplementation: For each p, we can compute prefix sums of distances of existing 1s sorted by distance. But distances depend on p.\n\nHowever, we can precompute positions of 1s and zeros. For a given p, distances to 1s are |pos - p|. The sorted distances are just the absolute differences. The sum of smallest t distances can be computed using order statistics? This is like we need sum of t smallest absolute differences between p and a set of points (positions of 1s). This can be computed using prefix sums of positions sorted globally, using binary search to find how many 1s on left/right within certain radius.\n\nWe can binary search radius r such that number of 1s within distance r (including at distance 0) is at least t. Then sum of distances of those within r can be computed using prefix sums of positions.\n\nSimilarly for zeros.\n\nThus for each p, we can compute minimal moves as: we need k tokens. Let cnt1 = number of 1s (including possibly at p). If cnt1 >= k, we just need sum of k smallest distances among 1s. Else need extra = k - cnt1, we will take all 1s distances sum, plus sum of extra smallest distances among zeros plus extra (the +1 each). So total = sumDist1_all + sumDistZeros_extra + extra*1.\n\nBut we may not need all 1s; we might not need to bring far 1s if zeros closer? Wait zeros cost distance+1, which is always >= distance of a 1 at same distance. So any zero at distance d is never better than a 1 at same distance. So we will always prefer all available 1s before any zero. So indeed we take all 1s (maybe not all if more than k). If more than k, we only take k nearest 1s.\n\nThus algorithm: For each p, compute distances to 1s sorted; take up to k nearest. If number of 1s >= k, total cost = sum of k nearest distances. Else total cost = sum of all distances of 1s + (k - cnt1) * 1 + sum of (k - cnt1) nearest distances among zeros.\n\nThus we need ability to compute sum of smallest t distances to 1s and zeros for each p efficiently.\n\nWe can precompute prefix sums of positions of 1s (sorted) and zeros.\n\nGiven p, distances to left side positions L (pos < p) are p - pos. To right side R (pos > p) are pos - p.\n\nIf we want sum of smallest t distances, we can think of expanding radius r until we have at least t points. The sum of distances of points within radius r is: for left side positions >= p - r, sum (p - pos) = count_left * p - sum_left_positions. Similarly right side sum = sum_right_positions - count_right * p.\n\nIf we have more than t points within radius r, we need to subtract excess farthest distances. That can be handled by taking exactly t points: we can compute number of points on left and right within radius r, then if total > t, we need to remove some farthest points (which are at distance r). Since points at exact distance r may be on both sides. Simpler: we can binary search radius r to get at least t points, then compute sum of distances of all points within radius r, then subtract (total - t) * r (since the extra points are at distance exactly r). This works because all points within radius r have distance <= r, and the farthest among them are at distance r. However there could be points with distance < r that we might need to drop if extra > number at distance r. But we can treat as we drop some points at distance r (the farthest). Since we only know count at distance exactly r maybe multiple. This works if we assume we can drop any of the points at distance r, which is fine because they all have same distance r.\n\nThus we need ability to count number of points with distance <= r: count = left_count + right_count where left positions >= p - r, right positions <= p + r.\n\nWe also need sum of positions of those points to compute sum distances.\n\nWe can precompute prefix sums of positions for 1s and zeros arrays.\n\nImplementation steps for a given p and t (t <= total points of that type):\n\nDefine arrays pos1 sorted, pref1 prefix sums.\n\nFunction sum_nearest(pos_array, pref, p, t):\n    if t == 0: return 0\n    # binary search radius r in [0, max(p, n-1-p)] maybe up to n.\n    lo=0, hi=n\n    while lo<hi:\n        mid=(lo+hi)//2\n        cnt = count points within distance mid.\n        if cnt >= t: hi=mid else lo=mid+1\n    r=lo\n    # compute cnt and sumDist for radius r\n    left_idx = lower_bound(pos_array, p - r)  # first >= p - r\n    right_idx = upper_bound(pos_array, p + r) -1  # last <= p + r\n    cnt = (len - left_idx)??

Actually right side positions > p.\n    right_start = max(p+1, left_idx)??

For each p, we need t = min(k, cnt1_total) maybe but we need to consider zeros if cnt1_total < k.\n\nLet totalOnes = len(pos1). For each p:\n    if totalOnes >= k:\n        cost = sum_nearest(pos1, pref1, p, k)\n    else:\n        needZeros = k - totalOnes\n        sumOnes = sum_nearest(pos1, pref1, p, totalOnes)  # all ones\n        sumZeros = sum_nearest(pos0, pref0, p, needZeros)\n        cost = sumOnes + sumZeros + needZeros  # +1 per created token\n    Keep minimal cost.\n\nBut note maxChanges limit: needZeros must be <= maxChanges. If needZeros > maxChanges, then this p is infeasible. Also we could consider using fewer existing ones and more zeros? But zeros are more expensive, so using all ones is optimal as long as maxChanges allows needed zeros. If needZeros > maxChanges, we cannot achieve k tokens from this p.

The problem says \"subsequence\" but examples: For nums=[1,2,3,4], k=3, they list subsequences: [1,2,3], [1,3,4], [1,2,4], [2,3,4]. Those are combinations (choose any 3 elements preserving order? Actually [1,2,4] is not contiguous but order preserved. So it's combinations of indices i<j<... of size k). So we need to consider all subsets of size k (combinations) and compute \"power\" defined as minimal absolute difference between any two elements in that subsequence. Then sum these powers over all subsets, modulo 1e9+7.\n\nConstraints: n up to 50, k up to n. Number of subsets C(50,25) huge, cannot brute force. Need combinatorial approach.\n\nWe need sum over all subsets S of size k of min_{i<j in S} |a_i - a_j|.\n\nObservation: The minimal absolute difference in a subset is determined by the closest pair among its elements. For each pair (i,j) with i<j, define d = |a_i - a_j|. This pair will be the minimal difference of a subset S iff:\n\n- The subset includes i and j.\n- For all other pairs (p,q) within S, their absolute difference >= d.\n- No other pair in S has difference < d.\n\nThus we can think of contributions of each pair as d times number of subsets where this pair is the unique (or at least one of) minimal difference and no smaller difference appears.\n\nWe can sort all pairs by their distance ascending. Use inclusion-exclusion: For each pair, count subsets where this pair is present and all other pairs in the subset have distance >= d. But if there are other pairs with same distance d, the minimal difference could be d as well; but the definition of minimal difference is the minimum value, not necessarily unique. So if there are multiple pairs with same minimal distance, the minimal difference is still d. So each subset with minimal distance d will be counted multiple times if we count each pair. We need to ensure each subset contributes d exactly once. So we need to count subsets where the minimal distance is exactly d, and then multiply by d. So we need number of subsets of size k whose minimal pairwise absolute difference equals d.\n\nWe can approach by sorting the array? The absolute differences depend on values, not positions. Since subsets are based on indices, but values may repeat.\n\nWe could sort the array values while preserving original indices? The minimal absolute difference in a subset depends only on values, not order. So we can treat the multiset of values.\n\nWe need to count subsets of size k where the minimal difference among chosen values is exactly d. This is similar to counting k-element subsets with minimum gap >= something. Classic combinatorial: number of subsets where all pairwise differences >= D is like selecting points with spacing constraint. But here we need exactly minimal = d, i.e., all differences >= d, and at least one pair with difference = d.\n\nWe can sort nums ascending. Then any subset corresponds to picking indices in sorted order (not original order). The pairwise differences are based on sorted values. The minimal difference will be between some adjacent elements in the sorted subset (since the smallest difference among any set occurs between some consecutive elements in sorted order). So we can focus on adjacent pairs in sorted order.\n\nThus for a subset S (size k) of sorted array, its minimal difference = min over consecutive elements in S of diff between them.\n\nTherefore we can count subsets where the minimal consecutive gap is exactly d.\n\nWe can precompute sorted array a. Let n <= 50, we can DP over positions and last selected element and current minimal gap? Could be O(n^2 * k). Since n small, we could brute force all subsets using bitmask? 2^50 impossible.\n\nBut we can DP: iterate over sorted positions, choose k elements. Keep track of the minimal gap seen so far. At the end, sum minimal gap. DP state: dp[i][j][m] = number of ways considering first i elements (i from 0..n), selected j elements, and current minimal gap = m (or maybe we store minimal gap value). Since values up to 2e8, but n small, number of distinct possible gaps is O(n^2) <= 1225. So we can map each possible gap to index.\n\nWe can DP counting ways and also sum of minimal gaps. Better: DP that accumulates total sum of minimal gaps for subsets of size k.\n\nWe can maintain dp[j][min_gap] = count of subsets of size j with current minimal gap = min_gap (where min_gap is the minimal difference among selected elements so far). When we add a new element at position i (value a[i]), we need to update min_gap based on difference with previously selected last element? Wait minimal gap depends on all pairwise differences, but the new minimal gap could be the min of previous min_gap and the smallest difference between new element and any previously selected element. Since sorted, the smallest difference to previous selected elements will be with the nearest selected element (the predecessor in sorted order). Because all earlier selected elements are <= new element, the closest is the largest selected index less than i. So we need to know the last selected index to compute diff with new element. So DP must also track the index of last selected element (or its value) to compute new gap.\n\nThus DP state: dp[i][j] = dict mapping last_selected_index to (count, sum_of_min_gaps). But n=50, k up to 50, we can do O(n^2 * k). Let's define dp[pos][cnt] = dict where key = last index (pos of last selected element), value = (count, total_min_sum). We'll iterate over positions in sorted order, and decide to select or not.\n\nSimplify: Use DP over positions with last selected index. For each position i, we can either start a new subset (first element) or extend existing subsets where last selected index = prev. When extending, new_min = min(prev_min, a[i] - a[prev]).\n\nThus we need to store for each (cnt, last) the count and sum of min values for subsets ending at last with size cnt and current min value = something? Actually we need to know the current min value to compute later. So we need to store min value as part of state too. That leads to O(n^3) maybe okay (50^3=125k). Since min values distinct up to O(n^2). Could store dp[cnt][last][min_idx] count.\n\nBut we can compress: Since when extending, new_min = min(prev_min, diff). So we can transition from any prev_min to new_min = min(prev_min, diff). So we need to know prev_min to compute new. So we need that dimension.\n\nThus DP size: cnt up to k (<=50), last up to n (<=50), min options up to O(n^2) (1225). So total states ~ 50*50*1225 = 3 million, okay.\n\nImplementation: Precompute sorted array a. Compute all possible diffs between any two indices i<j: diff = a[j]-a[i] (non-negative). Collect unique diffs, sort, map to index.\n\nInitialize dp[1][i][inf]?? For a subset of size 1, minimal difference is undefined (infinite). For convenience, we can treat min as large sentinel (e.g., INF = max_diff+1). When we later compute final sum for size k, we need min diff among at least two elements, so subsets of size 1 will not be counted. So we can start DP with size 1 having min = INF.\n\nDP representation: dp[cnt][last][min_idx] = count of subsets of size cnt ending at index last with current minimal diff = diff_vals[min_idx] (or INF sentinel). We'll also need sum of mins? Actually we only need final sum of mins for size k across all subsets, not per state. We can accumulate at the end: for cnt=k, sum over all last and min_idx (excluding INF) of count * diff_vals[min_idx].\n\nThus we just need counts.\n\nTransitions: For each cnt from 1 to k-1, for each last, for each min_idx with count>0, we can try to add a new element nxt > last. Compute diff = a[nxt] - a[last]. new_min = min(current_min, diff). Determine new_min_idx: if current_min is INF sentinel, then new_min = diff. else new_min = min(current_min, diff). Use mapping to index.\n\nAdd count to dp[cnt+1][nxt][new_min_idx].\n\nComplexities: loops O(k * n^2 * M) where M is number of min values? Actually for each state we iterate nxt > last, which is O(n). So total O(k * n^3 * something). n=50, k up to 50, worst-case maybe 50*125k = 6.25 million, fine.\n\nImplementation details:\n\n- Sort nums to a.\n- Compute diffs list: all a[j]-a[i] for i<j. Add sentinel INF = max_diff+1.\n- Map diff to index via dict.\n- Initialize dp as list of list of dict? Use list of list of list of ints: dp[cnt][last][min_idx] = count. Dimensions: (k+1) x n x M. M up to 1226. That's about 51*50*1226 ~ 3.1 million ints, okay.\n\nInitialize dp[1][i][inf_idx] = 1 for each i (choose single element at i). Actually subsets of size 1 can start at any i.\n\nThen iterate cnt from 1 to k-1:\n for last in range(n):\n   for min_idx in range(M):\n     cnt_val = dp[cnt][last][min_idx]\n     if cnt_val==0: continue\n     for nxt in range(last+1, n):\n        diff = a[nxt]-a[last]\n        if min_idx == inf_idx:\n            new_min = diff\n        else:\n            cur_min = diff_vals[min_idx]\n            new_min = cur_min if cur_min < diff else diff\n        new_idx = diff_to_idx[new_min]\n        dp[cnt+1][nxt][new_idx] = (dp[cnt+1][nxt][new_idx] + cnt_val) % MOD\n\nAfter DP, compute answer = sum_{last, min_idx != inf_idx} dp[k][last][min_idx] * diff_vals[min_idx] % MOD.\n\nEdge Cases: k=1?

Need to return minimal possible length of t.\n\nEssentially we need smallest L such that s can be partitioned into blocks of length L, each block being an anagram of same multiset of characters. So we need to find smallest L dividing len(s) such that for each position modulo L, the multiset of characters across blocks is consistent? Wait: each block must be a permutation of t, meaning each block has same character counts as t. So overall, the total count of each character in s must be k times count in t, where k = len(s)/L. So t's character counts are total_counts / k, must be integer.\n\nThus L must be such that for each character, total_counts[char] % k == 0, where k = n / L. Equivalent: L must be a divisor of n such that for all chars, total_counts[char] * L % n == 0? Let's derive.\n\nLet n = len(s). Let k = n / L (integer). For each char c, let total[c] be count in s. Then count in t = total[c] / k must be integer. So total[c] must be divisible by k for all c. So condition: k divides total[c] for all c. Since k = n / L, we need n/L divides total[c] for all c. So L must be such that for all c, total[c] * L / n is integer? Actually total[c] / k integer => total[c] * L / n integer (since k = n/L). So L must be such that for each c, (total[c] * L) % n == 0.\n\nWe need minimal L satisfying that and also that we can partition s into blocks of length L each being an anagram of t. Is the divisibility condition sufficient? Not necessarily; we also need that there exists a partition where each block has exactly those counts. But if we can reorder within each block arbitrarily, we can assign characters to blocks as needed as long as each block gets the required multiset. Since we cannot reorder across blocks; the original s order is fixed. We need to check if we can split s sequentially into blocks of length L such that each block's character multiset equals t's multiset. That's a more complex constraint.\n\nBut maybe the problem statement: s is known to be concatenation of anagrams of t. So there exists some t and some partition (unknown) that works. We need minimal possible length of t consistent with that fact. So we need to find minimal L such that there exists a partition of s into blocks of length L each being an anagram of same multiset. Since we know such a partition exists for some L (maybe n). Need minimal.\n\nWe can think of scanning and building counts for a candidate block. The minimal L would be the length of the smallest prefix that can be repeated (as multiset) to cover s. This is similar to finding smallest segment where cumulative counts never exceed multiples? Approach: iterate through s, maintain a frequency map for current block. When the current block's frequencies equal target frequencies (unknown), we can close block and start new. But target unknown.\n\nObservation: Since each block is an anagram of t, the multiset of characters in each block is identical. Therefore, the multiset of characters in any prefix that ends at a block boundary must be a multiple of the multiset of t. So the multiset of characters in prefix of length p must be such that for each char, count is divisible by (p / L). So the condition for a prefix length p to be a block boundary is that for some L dividing p, the counts are proportional.\n\nBut we need minimal L overall. Equivalent to find smallest L such that we can partition s into blocks of length L where each block's multiset equals the multiset of the first block (or any). Since we don't know partition, we can try to simulate building blocks greedily: start with empty target multiset unknown; as we read characters, we accumulate counts. When the accumulated counts equal some multiset that could be t, we need to decide when to cut.\n\nIdea: The minimal L is the length of the smallest prefix such that its character multiset can be repeated (as multiset) to form the whole string s. That is, there exists integer k = n / L such that for each char, total[c] = k * prefix_counts[c]. Additionally, the string can be partitioned accordingly (i.e., the prefix multiset repeated k times can be arranged to match the actual order). But is the order constraint automatically satisfied? Not necessarily; e.g., s = \"abca\", total counts a:2,b:1,c:1. n=4. Suppose L=2, prefix \"ab\" counts a:1,b:1. k=2, need total a:2,b:2, but we have b:1,c:1, fails. So divisibility fails.\n\nConsider s = \"aabb\". total a:2,b:2. n=4. L=2, prefix \"aa\"? counts a:2. k=2 => need total a:4, fails. So not.\n\nBut suppose s = \"ab ba\"? Actually s = \"abba\". total a:2,b:2. L=2, prefix \"ab\" counts a:1,b:1. k=2 => total a:2,b:2 matches. Can we partition into blocks of length 2 each anagram of \"ab\"? s = \"ab\"+\"ba\" works. So condition holds.\n\nIs there case where divisibility holds but partition impossible? Example: s = \"aababb\". n=6. total a:3,b:3. L=3, prefix \"aab\" counts a:2,b:1. k=2 => total a:4,b:2 not match. So fails.\n\nTry to construct where total counts divisible but order prevents partition: s = \"aaabbb\". total a:3,b:3. n=6. L=3, prefix \"aaa\" counts a:3. k=2 => total a:6 not match. So fails.\n\nMaybe if total counts divisible, we can always partition? Not always. Consider s = \"abac\". total a:2,b:1,c:1. n=4. L=2, need each block counts a:1,b:0,c:0? Not possible. Divisibility fails.\n\nI think the necessary and sufficient condition is that there exists L dividing n such that for each char, total[c] % (n/L) == 0 (i.e., k divides total). Additionally, we need to be able to split s into blocks of length L each having those counts. This is equivalent to checking if we can slide a window of length L and each window's multiset equals target. That's like verifying that the string can be partitioned accordingly.\n\nWe can attempt to find minimal L by iterating over divisors of n in increasing order, and for each L, compute target counts = total_counts * L / n (since total = k * target, target = total / k = total * L / n). Then we need to verify that we can partition s into blocks of length L each having exactly those counts. Verification can be done by scanning blocks and comparing frequency counts.\n\nComplexities: n up to 1e5, number of divisors up to ~300. For each divisor, we need O(n) to verify, leading to O(n * d) ~ 3e7 worst-case, okay.\n\nImplementation steps:\n\n- Compute n, total_counts (array size 26).\n- Get list of divisors of n sorted ascending.\n- For each L in divisors:\n    - k = n // L\n    - For each char i, if total_counts[i] % k != 0: continue to next L.\n    - target_counts[i] = total_counts[i] // k\n    - Now verify: iterate i from 0 to n step L:\n        - compute counts of s[i:i+L] (could use sliding window per block). Since L may be up to n, we can compute per block by counting characters in that substring (O(L) each) leading to O(n) total per L.\n        - Compare with target_counts; if any mismatch, break.\n    - If all blocks match, return L.\n\nEdge case: L = n always works because k=1, target = total, and the only block is s itself, which matches.\n\nThus minimal L found.\n\nOptimization: Precompute prefix sums for each character to get block counts in O(1) per block: prefix_counts[char][i] = count up to i (exclusive). Then block count = prefix[char][i+L] - prefix[char][i]. This allows O(26) per block, still O(26 * n / L) per L, total O(26 * n * d / average L). Might be okay.\n\nSimpler: just count per block using Counter for each block; O(L) per block, total O(n) per L.

Need efficient O(n). Let's think.\n\nWe need count of subarrays [l..r] such that max(nums[l..r]) == nums[l] == nums[r].\n\nThus the maximum of subarray must be at both ends, and equal to those ends. So the subarray's maximum value appears at both ends, and no element inside exceeds that value.\n\nThus for any pair (l,r) with l<=r, condition: nums[l]==nums[r] and for all k in [l,r], nums[k] <= nums[l].\n\nSo essentially subarray where the maximum value is some value v, and the subarray's endpoints are positions where value v occurs, and between them all values <= v.\n\nWe can think of scanning for each value v, consider contiguous segments where all elements <= v, and within each segment count pairs of positions where value == v. For each segment, if there are m occurrences of v, number of subarrays with endpoints at those occurrences = m choose 2 + m (single-element subarrays counted as l=r). That's m*(m+1)/2.\n\nThus overall answer = sum over each value v of sum over each maximal segment where all elements <= v of m*(m+1)/2 where m is count of v in that segment.\n\nBut naive over all v is heavy.\n\nAlternative: Use monotonic stack to find for each position i, the nearest greater element to left and right (strictly greater). For position i as a potential endpoint (value v = nums[i]), any subarray where i is left endpoint and right endpoint j (j>=i) with same value v and no element > v in between. That means j must be within the interval (i, next_greater_right[i]) exclusive, and also left bound must be > previous_greater_left[i]. For left endpoint i, the allowed right endpoints j are positions with same value v within (i, right_limit) where right_limit = next_greater_right[i] - 1 (or n-1 if none). Also need that left endpoint i is after previous greater element, but that's automatically satisfied because we consider i as leftmost; any subarray starting at i cannot include any element > v to left (none). Actually condition for subarray [i..j] is that max in [i..j] = v, so there must be no element > v in that range. So both i and j must be within a region where all elements <= v, bounded by greater elements on both sides. For each value v, the region between two greater elements (strictly greater) forms a block where max <= v. Within that block, positions with value v can pair.\n\nThus we can process using stack to find for each index i, the left boundary L = index of previous greater element (strictly greater) +1, and right boundary R = index of next greater element -1. Then the block for value v = nums[i] is [L,R]. Within this block, we need to count pairs of positions with same value v. For each value v, we could collect positions and for each position compute its block, but overlapping blocks for same value may be larger.\n\nObservation: For any two positions i<j with same value v, the subarray [i..j] is valid iff there is no element > v between i and j. That is equivalent to max in (i,j) <= v. So we just need to count pairs of equal values where the maximum between them is <= that value. This is similar to counting pairs where the maximum in interval equals the value (since endpoints are that value). This can be solved using a monotonic stack scanning and using a map of last occurrences? Not trivial.\n\nWe can use divide and conquer (like counting subarrays where max equals endpoints) using segment tree? But constraints up to 1e5, O(n log n) okay.\n\nSimpler: For each distinct value v, consider the array and split by positions where element > v (these are separators). Within each segment (contiguous region where all elements <= v), count occurrences of v, compute m*(m+1)/2. Sum over all v. Since values up to 1e9, we cannot iterate all v. But we can process by sorting positions by value descending. As we lower threshold, we merge segments.\n\nIdea: Process values in decreasing order. Use DSU to maintain segments of positions that have been \"activated\" (i.e., elements <= current threshold). Initially none activated. When we process a value v, we activate all positions where nums[pos] == v. When we activate a position, we union with neighboring activated positions (since those have value <= v). Each DSU component tracks count of occurrences of current value v within that component? But as we go decreasing, previously activated positions have values > v? Wait we process descending, so when we are at value v, all positions with value > v have already been activated, but they are > v, which should act as separators (cannot be inside segment for v). Actually we need segments where all elements <= v, meaning positions with value > v break segments. If we process descending, when we are at v, positions with value > v are already activated, but they should be considered as blockers, not part of allowed segment. So DSU of activated positions not suitable.\n\nInstead process ascending: when we increase threshold, we add positions with value <= current threshold, merging segments. For each value v, when we reach threshold = v, the segments formed consist of positions where nums <= v. Within each segment, we need to count subarrays where endpoints are positions with value exactly v. At the moment we add positions with value v, they become new endpoints. We need to count pairs among these newly added positions that lie within same segment (i.e., no >v between them). Since all >v are not yet added, they are still separators. So this works.\n\nAlgorithm:\n- Sort unique values ascending.\n- Maintain DSU for positions that are \"active\" (value <= current threshold). Initially none active.\n- For each value v in ascending order:\n   - For each index i where nums[i] == v:\n        - Activate i: set parent[i]=i, size[i]=1 (size of component). Also maintain count_v[i] = 1 (number of positions with value v in this component). Also maybe total count of v in component.\n        - If neighbor i-1 is active, union(i, i-1). Similarly i+1.\n   - After all unions for this value, we need to compute contribution of subarrays where both endpoints are value v within each component. For each component, suppose it contains k positions with value v (others have smaller values). The number of subarrays with endpoints both value v and max=v is k*(k+1)//2. However, we must ensure we don't double count subarrays counted earlier for smaller v. Since earlier thresholds (smaller values) would have counted subarrays where max is that smaller value. For current v, subarrays where max=v are new because they contain at least one position with value v (the max). Indeed any subarray with max=v must have at least one occurrence of v, and all elements <=v. When we process v, the component may also contain positions with value v that were just added, and possibly earlier added positions with value <v. The subarrays with both endpoints = v are counted now. They were not counted before because endpoints needed to be value equal to max, which was smaller before. So we can safely add k*(k+1)//2 for each component after processing v, but we must ensure we only count subarrays where both endpoints are v, not those where endpoints are smaller values (which were counted earlier). Since we only add contribution based on count of v in component, that's fine.\n\nImplementation details:\n- Need to know for each component the current count of positions with value equal to current v. Since we process values one by one, after processing v, we will not need that count again. So we can compute contribution on the fly: when we activate a position i with value v, we can start with cnt=1 for its component. When we union two components, we need to sum their cnt_v (counts of positions with value v). After union, we have total cnt_v for the merged component. At the end of processing all positions of value v, we need to sum over each component's cnt_v contribution: cnt_v*(cnt_v+1)//2. However, note that a component may have been formed earlier (by merging with neighbor components that already contain some v positions from earlier in same value batch). So we need to ensure we compute contribution after all unions for this value, and only once per component.\n\nWe can keep a dict mapping root -> cnt_v for current value. While processing each position, after activation and unions, we can update cnt_v in root. At the end of value batch, iterate over roots that have cnt_v>0 (we can collect them in a set) and add contribution, then clear cnt_v for next value (or we can just not store across values).\n\nSimplify: For each value v, we process its positions. For each position i:\n   - active[i]=True\n   - parent[i]=i, size[i]=1\n   - cnt[i]=1 (since this component has one v)\n   - For each neighbor that is active, union(i, neighbor). In union, we sum cnt values.\nAfter processing all positions of v, we need to add contribution for each distinct component root that was involved. We can collect roots after each union or after processing all positions: for each position i of this value, find root r = find(i), and if not already accounted, add contribution cnt[r]*(cnt[r]+1)//2 and mark accounted.\n\nComplexities O(n α(n)).\n\nEdge cases: single element array works.\n\nLet's implement function count_subarrays(nums) returning int.\n\nNeed to handle up to 1e5, answer may be up to n*(n+1)/2 ~ 5e10 fits in 64-bit.\n\nImplementation steps:\n\n- n = len(nums)\n- Build dict value_to_indices: using default dict list.\n- For each idx, append to dict[nums[idx]].\n- Sort keys ascending.\n- Initialize arrays parent = [-1]*n, active = [False]*n, cnt = [0]*n\n- Define find with path compression.\n- Define union(a,b): find roots ra, rb; if same return; attach smaller size to larger; parent[rb]=ra; size[ra]+=size[rb]; cnt[ra]+=cnt[rb]; return ra.\n\n- total = 0\n- For each v in sorted keys:\n    roots_set = set()\n    for i in value_to_indices[v]:\n        active[i]=True\n        parent[i]=i\n        size[i]=1\n        cnt[i]=1\n        # left neighbor\n        if i-1>=0 and active[i-1]:\n            union(i, i-1)\n        if i+1<n and active[i+1]:\n            union(i, i+1)\n    # after all unions, compute contributions\n    for i in value_to_indices[v]:\n        r = find(i)\n        if r not in roots_set:\n            roots_set.add(r)\n            k = cnt[r]\n            total += k*(k+1)//2\n    # optional: reset cnt for these roots?

Need efficient O(n). Let's think.\n\nWe need count of subarrays [l..r] such that max(nums[l..r]) == nums[l] == nums[r].\n\nThus the maximum of subarray must be at both ends, and equal to those ends. So the subarray's maximum value appears at both ends, and no element inside exceeds that value.\n\nThus for any pair (l,r) with l<=r, condition: nums[l]==nums[r] and for all k in [l,r], nums[k] <= nums[l].\n\nSo essentially subarray where the maximum value is some value v, and the subarray's endpoints are positions where value v occurs, and between them all values <= v.\n\nWe can think of scanning for each value v, consider contiguous segments where all elements <= v, and within each segment count pairs of positions where value == v. For each segment, if there are m occurrences of v, number of subarrays with endpoints at those occurrences = m choose 2 + m (single-element subarrays counted as l=r). That's m*(m+1)/2.\n\nThus overall answer = sum over each value v of sum over each maximal segment where all elements <= v of m*(m+1)/2 where m is count of v in that segment.\n\nBut naive over all v is heavy.\n\nAlternative: Use monotonic stack to find for each position i, the nearest greater element to left and right (strictly greater). For position i as a potential endpoint (value v = nums[i]), any subarray where i is left endpoint and right endpoint j (j>=i) with same value v and no element > v in between. That means j must be within the interval (i, next_greater_right[i]) exclusive, and also left bound must be > previous_greater_left[i]. For left endpoint i, the allowed right endpoints j are positions with same value v within (i, right_limit) where right_limit = next_greater_right[i] - 1 (or n-1 if none). Also need that left endpoint i is after previous greater element, but that's automatically satisfied because we consider i as leftmost; any subarray starting at i cannot include any element > v to left (none). Actually condition for subarray [i..j] is that max in [i..j] = v, so there must be no element > v in that range. So both i and j must be within a region where all elements <= v, bounded by greater elements on both sides. For each value v, the region between two greater elements (strictly greater) forms a block where max <= v. Within that block, positions with value v can pair.\n\nThus we can process using stack to find for each index i, the left boundary L = index of previous greater element (strictly greater) +1, and right boundary R = index of next greater element -1. Then the block for value v = nums[i] is [L,R]. Within this block, we need to count pairs of positions with same value v. For each value v, we could collect positions and for each position compute its block, but overlapping blocks for same value may be larger.\n\nObservation: For any two positions i<j with same value v, the subarray [i..j] is valid iff there is no element > v between i and j. That is equivalent to max in (i,j) <= v. So we just need to count pairs of equal values where the maximum between them is <= that value. This is similar to counting pairs where the maximum in interval equals the value (since endpoints are that value). This can be solved using a monotonic stack scanning and using a map of last occurrences? Not trivial.\n\nWe can use divide and conquer (like counting subarrays where max equals endpoints) using segment tree? But constraints up to 1e5, O(n log n) okay.\n\nSimpler: For each distinct value v, consider the array and split by positions where element > v (these are separators). Within each segment (contiguous region where all elements <= v), count occurrences of v, compute m*(m+1)/2. Sum over all v. Since values up to 1e9, we cannot iterate all v. But we can process by sorting positions by value descending. As we lower threshold, we merge segments.\n\nIdea: Process values in decreasing order. Use DSU to maintain segments of positions that have been \"activated\" (i.e., elements <= current threshold). Initially none activated. When we process a value v, we activate all positions where nums[pos] == v. When we activate a position, we union with neighboring activated positions (since those have value <= v). Each DSU component tracks count of occurrences of current value v within that component? But as we go decreasing, previously activated positions have values > v? Wait we process descending, so when we are at value v, all positions with value > v have already been activated, but they are > v, which should act as separators (cannot be inside segment for v). Actually we need segments where all elements <= v, meaning positions with value > v break segments. If we process descending, when we are at v, positions with value > v are already activated, but they should be considered as blockers, not part of allowed segment. So DSU of activated positions not suitable.\n\nInstead process ascending: when we increase threshold, we add positions with value <= current threshold, merging segments. For each value v, when we reach threshold = v, the segments formed consist of positions where nums <= v. Within each segment, we need to count subarrays where endpoints are positions with value exactly v. At the moment we add positions with value v, they become new endpoints. We need to count pairs among these newly added positions that lie within same segment (i.e., no >v between them). Since all >v are not yet added, they are still separators. So this works.\n\nAlgorithm:\n- Sort unique values ascending.\n- Maintain DSU for positions that are \"active\" (value <= current threshold). Initially none active.\n- For each value v in ascending order:\n   - For each index i where nums[i] == v:\n        - Activate i: set parent[i]=i, size[i]=1 (size of component). Also maintain count_v[i] = 1 (number of positions with value v in this component). Also maybe total count of v in component.\n        - If neighbor i-1 is active, union(i, i-1). Similarly i+1.\n   - After all unions for this value, we need to compute contribution of subarrays where both endpoints are value v within each component. For each component, suppose it contains k positions with value v (others have smaller values). The number of subarrays with endpoints both value v and max=v is k*(k+1)//2. However, we must ensure we don't double count subarrays counted earlier for smaller v. Since earlier thresholds (smaller values) would have counted subarrays where max is that smaller value. For current v, subarrays where max=v are new because they contain at least one position with value v (the max). Indeed any subarray with max=v must have at least one occurrence of v, and all elements <=v. When we process v, the component may also contain positions with value v that were just added, and possibly earlier added positions with value <v. The subarrays with both endpoints = v are counted now. They were not counted before because endpoints needed to be value equal to max, which was smaller before. So we can safely add k*(k+1)//2 for each component after processing v, but we must ensure we only count subarrays where both endpoints are v, not those where endpoints are smaller values (which were counted earlier).

Need to generate big_nums array conceptually: concatenation of minimal-length sequences of powers of two that sum to i, for i=1,2,3,...\n\nObservation: For each integer x, its binary representation gives powers of two that sum to x. Minimal length sequence of powers of two sorted ascending? The example for 11: binary 1011 = 1+2+8 => [1,2,8] matches. So efficient array for x is list of powers of two corresponding to set bits, sorted ascending.\n\nThus big_nums is concatenation of binary set bits of each i in order.\n\nSo big_nums is sequence of powers of two for each i, each i contributes its set bits in ascending order (i.e., from least significant to most). So big_nums is essentially the list of all 2^k for each i, for each set bit.\n\nWe need product of a subarray modulo mod. Since mod varies per query, cannot precompute prefix products modulo a fixed modulus. But we can use prime factorization? Since elements are powers of two, product is 2^{total exponent}. So product = 2^{sum of exponents of each element}. Each element is 2^k, exponent = k. So product = 2^{E}. Then result = 2^{E} mod m.\n\nThus we need to compute sum of exponents in range [L,R] (0-index? The examples: query [1,3] gave big_nums[1..3] = [2,1,2]. Let's compute big_nums starting index 0? Let's generate first few i:\n\ni=1: bits: 1 => [1] (2^0)\ni=2: bits: 2 => [2] (2^1)\ni=3: bits: 1,2 => [1,2]\ni=4: bits: 4 => [4]\ni=5: bits:1,4 => [1,4]\ni=6: bits:2,4 => [2,4]\ni=7: bits:1,2,4 => [1,2,4]\ni=8: bits:8 => [8]\nConcatenated: [1,2,1,2,4,1,4,2,4,1,2,4,8,...] matches given.\n\nIndices: Let's index from 0: idx0=1, idx1=2, idx2=1, idx3=2, idx4=4,...\n\nIn example 1 query [1,3] gave subarray [2,1,2] which corresponds to indices 1..3 inclusive: idx1=2, idx2=1, idx3=2. So they use 0-based indexing. Good.\n\nThus we need to compute sum of exponents (k) for positions L..R inclusive.\n\nWe need to map position to which i and which bit within i.\n\nWe can think of iterating i and its set bits. Need to answer up to 500 queries, but positions up to 1e15, huge. Need efficient method to compute prefix sum of exponents up to position p: S(p) = sum_{pos=0..p} exponent.\n\nThen answer for query L,R = S(R) - S(L-1). Then compute pow(2, total_exponent, mod).\n\nSo need to compute S(p) quickly.\n\nObservation: For each i, its contribution to exponent sum is sum of positions of set bits = sum_{k where bit k set} k. So total exponent sum up to i = sum_{j=1..i} popcount(j) weighted by bit positions.\n\nWe need prefix over concatenated sequence, not over i. The number of elements up to i is total bits count = sum_{j=1..i} popcount(j).

That's count of ones in binary representations from 1 to i.\n\nSimilarly, we need cumulative exponent sum E(i) = sum_{j=1..i} sum_{k where bit k set in j} k.\n\nWe can compute E(i) using similar formula: For each bit position k, each time bit k is set contributes k to exponent sum. Number of times bit k is set among numbers 1..i is same as count of ones at that bit: C_k(i) = floor(i / 2^{k+1}) * 2^{k} + max(0, (i mod 2^{k+1}) - 2^{k} +1). Then contribution to exponent sum is k * C_k(i). So E(i) = sum_{k=0..maxbit} k * C_k(i).\n\nThus we can compute B(i) and E(i) in O(log i) time.\n\nNow to compute S(p): find smallest i such that B(i) > p. Let i0 = that i. Then previous total bits before i0: B(i0-1) <= p. offset = p - B(i0-1) (0-index within bits of i0). The bits of i0 are its set bits in ascending order (k values). So we need sum of first offset+1 exponents among its set bits.\n\nWe can get list of set bits of i0 (positions). Since i0 up to maybe large (since p up to 1e15, i0 roughly similar magnitude). Number of bits <= 60. So we can extract bits.\n\nLet bits = sorted list of k where i0 has bit set (ascending). Then sum_partial = sum(bits[0:offset+1]).\n\nThus S(p) = E(i0-1) + sum_partial.\n\nEdge case p <0 => S(-1)=0.\n\nImplement function prefix_sum(p): if p<0 return 0 else compute as above.\n\nNow for each query, compute total_exp = prefix_sum(R) - prefix_sum(L-1).

Need to generate big_nums array conceptually: concatenation of minimal-length sequences of powers of two that sum to i, for i=1,2,3,...\n\nObservation: For each integer x, its binary representation gives powers of two that sum to x. Minimal length sequence of powers of two sorted ascending? The example for 11: binary 1011 = 1+2+8 => [1,2,8] matches. So efficient array for x is list of powers of two corresponding to set bits, sorted ascending.\n\nThus big_nums is concatenation of binary set bits of each i in order.\n\nSo big_nums is sequence of powers of two for each i, each i contributes its set bits in ascending order (i.e., from least significant to most). So big_nums is essentially the list of all 2^k for each i, for each set bit.\n\nWe need product of a subarray modulo mod. Since mod varies per query, cannot precompute prefix products modulo a fixed modulus. But we can use prime factorization? Since elements are powers of two, product is 2^{total exponent}. So product = 2^{sum of exponents of each element}. Each element is 2^k, exponent = k. So product = 2^{E}. Then result = 2^{E} mod m.\n\nThus we need to compute sum of exponents in range [L,R] (0-index? The examples: query [1,3] gave big_nums[1..3] = [2,1,2]. Let's compute big_nums starting index 0? Let's generate first few i:\n\ni=1: bits: 1 => [1] (2^0)\ni=2: bits: 2 => [2] (2^1)\ni=3: bits: 1,2 => [1,2]\ni=4: bits: 4 => [4]\ni=5: bits:1,4 => [1,4]\ni=6: bits:2,4 => [2,4]\ni=7: bits:1,2,4 => [1,2,4]\ni=8: bits:8 => [8]\nConcatenated: [1,2,1,2,4,1,4,2,4,1,2,4,8,...] matches given.\n\nIndices: Let's index from 0: idx0=1, idx1=2, idx2=1, idx3=2, idx4=4,...\n\nIn example 1 query [1,3] gave subarray [2,1,2] which corresponds to indices 1..3 inclusive: idx1=2, idx2=1, idx3=2. So they use 0-based indexing. Good.\n\nThus we need to compute sum of exponents (k) for positions L..R inclusive.\n\nWe need to map position to which i and which bit within i.\n\nWe can think of iterating i and its set bits. Need to answer up to 500 queries, but positions up to 1e15, huge. Need efficient method to compute prefix sum of exponents up to position p: S(p) = sum_{pos=0..p} exponent.\n\nThen answer for query L,R = S(R) - S(L-1). Then compute pow(2, total_exponent, mod).\n\nSo need to compute S(p) quickly.\n\nObservation: For each i, its contribution to exponent sum is sum of positions of set bits = sum_{k where bit k set} k. So total exponent sum up to i = sum_{j=1..i} popcount(j) weighted by bit positions.\n\nWe need prefix over concatenated sequence, not over i. The number of elements up to i is total bits count = sum_{j=1..i} popcount(j). So position p corresponds to some i and offset within its bits.\n\nWe need to compute S(p) = sum of exponents of first p+1 elements.\n\nWe can binary search i such that total_bits_up_to_i > p.\n\nDefine B(i) = total number of set bits in numbers 1..i. Known function: B(i) = sum_{k>=0} floor(i / 2^{k+1}) * 2^{k} + max(0, (i mod 2^{k+1}) - 2^{k} +1). That's count of ones in binary representations from 1 to i.\n\nSimilarly, we need cumulative exponent sum E(i) = sum_{j=1..i} sum_{k where bit k set in j} k.\n\nWe can compute E(i) using similar formula: For each bit position k, each time bit k is set contributes k to exponent sum. Number of times bit k is set among numbers 1..i is same as count of ones at that bit: C_k(i) = floor(i / 2^{k+1}) * 2^{k} + max(0, (i mod 2^{k+1}) - 2^{k} +1). Then contribution to exponent sum is k * C_k(i). So E(i) = sum_{k=0..maxbit} k * C_k(i).\n\nThus we can compute B(i) and E(i) in O(log i) time.\n\nNow to compute S(p): find smallest i such that B(i) > p. Let i0 = that i. Then previous total bits before i0: B(i0-1) <= p. offset = p - B(i0-1) (0-index within bits of i0). The bits of i0 are its set bits in ascending order (k values).

Regions colored black/white like a checkerboard: adjacent regions across any line have opposite colors. The region containing point (0.5,0.5) is black.\n\nWe need area of black region within axis-aligned rectangle [A,C] x [B,D] (including interior). Output area *2? Wait: they say \"print the area twice\". Actually they say \"print the area two times\". In examples: first example rectangle (0,0)-(3,3). Area of black region is 5, they print 10. So they output 2*area. Second example area 5.5, they print 11. So output is 2*area, which is integer.\n\nThus we need compute 2 * black area within rectangle.\n\nWe need to understand pattern. Let's define coloring function f(x,y) = 0 for white, 1 for black. Adjacent across any line flips. Starting from (0.5,0.5) black.\n\nWe can think of parity of number of lines crossed from (0.5,0.5) to point (x,y). Since lines are of three families: vertical at integer x, horizontal at even y, diagonal x+y = even.\n\nCrossing a line toggles color. So color = parity of count of lines crossed.\n\nThus f(x,y) = ( number of vertical integer lines with x' between 0.5 and x ) + ( number of horizontal even lines between 0.5 and y ) + ( number of diagonal even lines between 0.5 and x+y ) mod 2.\n\nBut we need to handle any real point. For region interior, the color is constant. So we can define for any point (x,y) not on any line, f = ( floor(x) - floor(0.5) )? Actually crossing vertical lines at integer x=n. Starting from 0.5, moving to x, number of integer lines crossed is count of integers n such that between 0.5 and x (exclusive). That's floor(x) - 0 if x>0.5? Let's compute: For x>0.5, integers n with 0.5 < n <= x? Actually crossing when you pass line x=n. Starting at 0.5 (not on line). If x>0.5, you cross each integer n where 0.5 < n <= x. So count = floor(x) - 0 (since smallest integer >0.5 is 1). So count = floor(x) for x>0.5. For x<0.5, you cross integers n where x < n <= 0.5? Actually moving left, crossing lines with n between x and 0.5. Count = number of integers n such that x < n <= 0.5. That's floor(0.5) - floor(x) maybe? floor(0.5)=0. So count = 0 - floor(x) = -floor(x). But need positive count. For negative x, floor(x) is <= x < floor(x)+1. Example x = -0.2, floor = -1. Integers between -0.2 and 0.5 are 0? Actually 0 is > -0.2 and <=0.5, also maybe -0? 0 only. So count =1. floor(0.5)=0, floor(x)=-1, 0 - (-1)=1 correct. So count = floor(0.5) - floor(x) = - floor(x). So general formula: vertical count = floor(x) if x>=0.5 else -floor(x). But that's same as floor(x) - floor(0.5)?? floor(0.5)=0, so vertical count = floor(x) - 0 = floor(x) for x>=0.5, and = -floor(x) for x<0.5. That's not linear.\n\nBetter to define parity using floor of x and maybe sign. Since we only need parity modulo 2, we can use floor(x) mod 2? Let's test: Starting point (0.5,0.5) black. Compute parity contributions: vertical count parity = floor(0.5) =0 (since x>0.5? Actually floor(0.5)=0). Horizontal even lines: y=even integer. Starting y=0.5, count of even integers crossed moving to y: similar count of even n between 0.5 and y. Since even integers are ... -2,0,2,... So count parity depends on floor(y/2) maybe.\n\nDiagonal lines x+y = even integer. Count of even integers between 0.5+0.5=1 and x+y.\n\nThus overall parity maybe expressed as ( floor(x) + floor(y/2) + floor((x+y)/2) ) mod 2? Need to verify.\n\nLet's test with point (0.5,0.5): floor(x)=0, floor(y/2)= floor(0.25)=0, floor((x+y)/2)= floor(1/2)=0 => sum 0 => black (parity 0 maybe black). So define black when sum even.\n\nNow test point (1.5,0.5): Should be opposite color? Let's think: crossing vertical line x=1 (since between 0.5 and 1.5). That's one toggle, so color flips to white. Compute sum: floor(1.5)=1, floor(0.5/2)=0, floor((2)/2)=1 => sum=2 even => black again? That's contradictory. So formula wrong.\n\nLet's compute contributions more carefully.\n\nDefine function g(x) = number of integer vertical lines crossed from 0.5 to x. For x>0.5: g = floor(x) - 0 (since integers >0.5 up to floor(x)). For x<0.5: g = - floor(x) (since floor(x) negative or zero). Actually for x<0.5, integers n with x < n <= 0.5. Since 0.5 not integer, the largest integer <=0.5 is 0. So count = number of integers n with x < n <=0. So that's 0 - floor(x) if floor(x) <=0? Example x=-1.2 floor=-2, integers -1,0? Wait -1 > -1.2 and <=0, also 0. So count=2 = 0 - (-2) =2 correct. So g = - floor(x) for x<0.5.\n\nThus g = floor(x) if x>=0.5 else -floor(x). This equals floor(x) xor? Actually parity of g is floor(x) mod 2 when x>=0.5, and (-floor(x)) mod 2 when x<0.5. Since -floor(x) mod 2 = floor(x) mod 2 (because modulo 2, -a ≡ a). So parity of g is floor(x) mod 2 regardless of side! Good. So vertical contribution parity = floor(x) mod 2.\n\nSimilarly horizontal lines are at even y = 2k. Count of even integers crossed from 0.5 to y. For y>0.5: count = number of even integers n with 0.5 < n <= y. That's floor(y/2) - floor(0.5/2)?? floor(0.5/2)=0. So count = floor(y/2). For y<0.5: count = number of even n with y < n <=0.5. Since 0.5 not even, largest even <=0.5 is 0. So count = 0 - floor(y/2) (where floor(y/2) is integer <= y/2). Example y=-0.2, y/2=-0.1 floor=-1, count =0 - (-1)=1. So parity = floor(y/2) mod 2 (since -floor(y/2) ≡ floor(y/2) mod2). So horizontal contribution parity = floor(y/2) mod 2.\n\nDiagonal lines x+y = even integer 2k. Count from 0.5+0.5=1 to s = x+y. For s>1: count = number of even integers n with 1 < n <= s. That's floor(s/2) - floor(1/2)= floor(s/2) -0 = floor(s/2). For s<1: count = number of even n with s < n <=1. Largest even <=1 is 0. So count = 0 - floor(s/2). Parity = floor(s/2) mod2 again. So diagonal contribution parity = floor((x+y)/2) mod 2.\n\nThus total parity = ( floor(x) + floor(y/2) + floor((x+y)/2) ) mod 2. Black when parity even (0). Let's test earlier point (1.5,0.5): floor(x)=1, floor(y/2)=0, floor((2)/2)=1 => sum=2 even => black, but we expected white. Let's double-check expectation: Starting at (0.5,0.5) black. Move to (1.5,0.5) crossing vertical line x=1 only, so toggle once => white. But also crossing diagonal line? The line x+y = even integer: at start s=1, which is odd, not a line. At end s=2.0, which is even integer line x+y=2. Did we cross that line? The path from (0.5,0.5) to (1.5,0.5) is horizontal line y=0.5, x from 0.5 to 1.5. The line x+y=2 is x+0.5=2 => x=1.5, which is endpoint. Does crossing at endpoint count? Adjacent regions across a line are different; the line itself is boundary. The point (1.5,0.5) lies on the line x+y=2 (since 1.5+0.5=2). But region interior does not include the line. The rectangle interior includes points not on lines. For area calculation, measure zero lines don't affect area. So the region containing (1.5,0.5) is ambiguous; but interior points near (1.5,0.5) with x slightly less than 1.5 have s<2, so they are on one side. So crossing the diagonal line at the endpoint does not affect interior region for points with x<1.5. So the region just left of line is white? Let's evaluate a point (1.4,0.5): floor(x)=1, floor(y/2)=0, floor((1.9)/2)= floor(0.95)=0 => sum=1 odd => white. Good. So our parity formula gives white for points with x<1.5. At x=1.5 exactly, floor(x)=1, floor((2)/2)=1, sum=2 even => black, but that's on the line, not interior. So parity formula works for interior points (excluding lines). So our earlier expectation of white for (1.5,0.5) interior is correct; but point on line is black per formula but irrelevant.\n\nThus black region defined by parity even.\n\nNow we need area of points (x,y) in rectangle where parity even. Since parity depends on floor functions, the region is a union of unit squares (or half-unit?) Actually floor(x) changes at integer x, floor(y/2) changes at y = even integer, floor((x+y)/2) changes at lines x+y = even integer. So pattern repeats with period 2 in both x and y? Let's consider transformation modulo 2.\n\nDefine X = floor(x) mod 2, Y = floor(y/2) mod 2, Z = floor((x+y)/2) mod 2. Parity = X+Y+Z mod2.\n\nWe can consider coordinates modulo 2 for x and y? Since floor(x) mod2 depends on integer part parity. For x in [k, k+1), X = k mod2. So X is constant within each unit vertical strip.\n\nSimilarly Y depends on floor(y/2) parity: y in [2m,2m+2) => floor(y/2)=m, Y = m mod2. So Y constant within strips of height 2.\n\nZ depends on floor((x+y)/2) parity: define s = x+y. For s in [2n,2n+2) => floor(s/2)=n, Z = n mod2. So Z constant within diagonal strips of width sqrt(2) but defined by s.\n\nThus pattern repeats with period 2 in both x and y? Let's test: shift x by 2 changes floor(x) by 2 => X unchanged. Shift y by 2 changes floor(y/2) by 1 => Y flips. Also s shifts by 2 => Z flips. So overall parity may change? Need to see overall periodicity of 4? Might be period 2 in x and 4 in y? But we can compute area analytically using inclusion-exclusion? Might be easier to compute total black area = (area of rectangle) /2? Not exactly because pattern not simple checkerboard due to diagonal lines.\n\nWe can compute using lattice counting: Since pattern defined by parity of linear function of floor values, the black region within any large rectangle may have area = half of total area? Let's test with examples: rectangle (0,0)-(3,3) area 9, black area 5 => not half (4.5). So not equal.\n\nWe need to compute exact area efficiently for coordinates up to 1e9.\n\nWe can treat the plane partitioned into cells where floor(x), floor(y/2), floor((x+y)/2) are constant. These cells are polygons (mostly triangles/quadrilaterals). But maybe we can compute black area as sum over integer lattice points? Since each unit square (x in [i,i+1), y in [j,j+1)) may be partially black due to diagonal lines. However diagonal lines cut across squares.\n\nObservation: lines x+y = even integer are diagonal lines with slope -1, spacing sqrt(2). Within each unit square, the diagonal line may cut it into two triangles. So black area may be half of unit square plus some offset.\n\nMaybe we can compute black area as integral of indicator function: f(x,y) = 1 if parity even else 0. Since parity depends on floor values, we can sum over integer i for x-strip, and within each strip integrate over y.\n\nWe can iterate over integer i from floor(A) to floor(C)-1 (potentially up to 2e9, too many). Need O(1) formula.\n\nWe need to find formula for black area in rectangle aligned to axes. Might be expressed as (area + something)/2 where something depends on boundary parity.\n\nConsider that the pattern is a 2-coloring of the planar graph formed by those lines, which is a periodic tiling with fundamental region maybe a parallelogram of area 2? Let's attempt to find fundamental domain.\n\nTake coordinates modulo 2 in both x and y? Let's sample points in [0,2) x [0,2). Compute black area via brute to see pattern. Let's quickly think: we can write small script but offline mental.\n\nBetter: Since lines are at integer x, even y, even x+y. The lattice generated by vectors (2,0) and (0,2) and (1,-1) maybe? The pattern repeats with period 2 in x and y? Let's test point (x+2, y+2): floor(x+2) = floor(x)+2 => X unchanged. floor((y+2)/2) = floor(y/2 +1) = floor(y/2)+1 => Y flips. floor((x+2 + y+2)/2) = floor((x+y)/2 +2) = floor((x+y)/2)+2 => Z unchanged. So parity changes by Y flip => overall parity flips. So not same.\n\nWhat about shift (2,0): X unchanged, Y unchanged, Z flips (since s+2). So parity flips. Shift (0,2): X unchanged, Y flips, Z flips => parity unchanged (since two flips). So translation (0,2) is symmetry. Similarly (2,0) flips, (2,2) flips? (2,2): X unchanged, Y flips, Z unchanged? s+4 => Z unchanged (since +2 in floor). Actually floor((s+4)/2)= floor(s/2+2)= floor(s/2)+2 => Z unchanged. So parity flips due to Y flip. So not.\n\nThus fundamental domain maybe 4x2 rectangle? Let's test translation (4,0): X unchanged (since +4), Z flips? s+4 => floor(s/2)+2 => Z unchanged. So parity unchanged. So period in x is 4? Wait earlier (2,0) flips, (4,0) unchanged, so period 4.\n\nSimilarly in y: shift (0,4): Y flips twice? floor((y+4)/2)= floor(y/2+2)= floor(y/2)+2 => Y unchanged. Z: s+4 => Z unchanged. So period 4 in y.\n\nThus pattern repeats every 4 in both axes. Let's verify: shift (4,0) leaves parity unchanged, shift (0,4) unchanged, shift (4,4) unchanged. So fundamental domain 4x4.\n\nThus we can compute black area in any rectangle by decomposing into full 4x4 blocks plus remainder edges.\n\nNow we need black area within a 4x4 block. Compute total black area in [0,4) x [0,4). Let's brute think: area = 16, black area maybe 8? Let's test with example rectangle (0,0)-(3,3) gave black area 5 out of 9, not half. For 4x4 maybe not half.\n\nWe can compute by enumerating small grid using code, but we need formula. Let's attempt manual: Since pattern periodic, we can precompute black area for each unit cell of size 1x1 within 4x4, maybe with diagonal cut.\n\nWithin each unit square [i,i+1) x [j,j+1), X = i mod2, Y = floor(j/2) mod2 (since j integer). Z depends on floor((i+j + something)/2). Since x+y in [i+j, i+j+2). The line x+y = even integer may cut square.\n\nWe can compute black area for each square analytically: For given i,j, define parity function p(x,y) = (i + floor(y/2) + floor((x+y)/2)) mod2, where i = floor(x). Since within square, i constant, floor(y/2) constant if j even? Actually y in [j,j+1). floor(y/2) = floor(j/2) because j integer, and j+1 <= j+1 < j+2, so floor(y/2) same as floor(j/2). So Y constant per square.\n\nThus parity depends only on floor((x+y)/2) which may be either floor((i+j)/2) or floor((i+j)/2)+1 depending on whether x+y crosses an even integer boundary within square.\n\nLet s0 = i + j. The even integers are multiples of 2. The interval of x+y within square is [s0, s0+2). So there is at most one even integer boundary at t = next even integer after s0 (if s0 not even) or at s0 (if s0 even) but that's boundary line of square. Since interior excludes boundary, the floor((x+y)/2) is constant within interior of square except when the interval crosses an even integer, i.e., when s0 < even <= s0+2. That occurs when s0 is odd (since then next even is s0+1). So if s0 is odd, then for points where x+y < s0+1, floor((x+y)/2) = floor(s0/2) = (s0-1)/2. For points where x+y > s0+1, floor = (s0+1)/2. The line x+y = s0+1 (even) cuts the square diagonally from (i+1, j) to (i, j+1). So square is split into two right triangles.\n\nThus parity within square is constant on each triangle.\n\nWe can compute black area in square:\n\nLet i_mod2 = i%2, Y = floor(j/2)%2.\n\nCase 1: s0 even => no diagonal cut, floor((x+y)/2) = s0/2 constant. Then parity = i_mod2 + Y + (s0/2 %2) mod2. If parity even => whole square black area =1, else 0.\n\nCase 2: s0 odd => diagonal cut. For lower-left triangle where x+y < s0+1 (i.e., below diagonal), floor = (s0-1)/2. For upper-right triangle where x+y > s0+1, floor = (s0+1)/2.\n\nCompute parity for each triangle: parity1 = i_mod2 + Y + ((s0-1)/2 %2) mod2. parity2 = i_mod2 + Y + ((s0+1)/2 %2) mod2.\n\nEach triangle area = 0.5. So black area contributed = 0.5 * ( (parity1 even) + (parity2 even) ).\n\nThus we can precompute for i in 0..3, j in 0..3.\n\nLet's compute quickly by mental or we can embed in code to compute 4x4 block area. Since we need final code, we can compute this block area programmatically at runtime (constant small loops). Then for large rectangle, compute number of full 4x4 blocks and remainder.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\nGiven A,B,C,D (A<C, B<D). Compute total black area = integrate over rectangle.\n\nWe can define function area_black(x1,y1,x2,y2) where rectangle coordinates are integers? Not necessarily integer boundaries. But A,B,C,D are integers. So rectangle edges align with integer grid lines. Good.\n\nThus rectangle consists of whole unit squares. So we can count per unit square using above method.\n\nThus we can compute total black area as sum over i from A to C-1, j from B to D-1 of black area of unit square (i,j). Since A,B,C,D up to 1e9, need O(1) using periodicity 4.\n\nWe can compute sum over i modulo 4 and j modulo 4 using counts.\n\nLet width = C - A, height = D - B.\n\nWe can compute count of squares for each residue class (i_mod4, j_mod4). For each i in [A, C-1], its residue = (i % 4 + 4) %4. Similarly j.\n\nNumber of i with residue r = floor((C-1 - r0)/4) - floor((A-1 - r0)/4) ??? Simpler: compute first i0 = smallest i >= A with i%4 = r. If i0 > C-1 then count 0 else count = ((C-1 - i0)//4) +1.\n\nSimilarly for j.\n\nThen total black area = sum_{ri,rj} count_i[ri] * count_j[rj] * black_area_per_square(ri, rj).\n\nWhere black_area_per_square returns 0,1,0.5 as per above.\n\nThus we need to compute black_area_per_square for residues modulo 4 (since pattern repeats every 4 in i and j). Indeed i_mod4 determines i_mod2 and also floor(j/2)%2 depends on j_mod4.\n\nCompute function:\n\ndef square_black(i_mod4, j_mod4):\n    i = i_mod4\n    j = j_mod4\n    i_mod2 = i & 1\n    Y = (j//2) & 1  # floor(j/2) mod2\n    s0 = i + j\n    if s0 % 2 == 0:\n        Z = (s0//2) & 1\n        parity = (i_mod2 + Y + Z) & 1\n        return 1.0 if parity == 0 else 0.0\n    else:\n        Z1 = ((s0-1)//2) & 1\n        Z2 = ((s0+1)//2) & 1\n        parity1 = (i_mod2 + Y + Z1) & 1\n        parity2 = (i_mod2 + Y + Z2) & 1\n        return (0.5 if parity1 == 0 else 0.0) + (0.5 if parity2 == 0 else 0.0)\n\nNow compute total black area (as float maybe .5). Then output 2*area as integer. Since area may be .5 increments, 2*area integer.\n\nWe can compute using rational numbers: store area2 = 2 * black area = integer. For each square, area2 contribution is:\n\n- If whole square black: 2\n- If whole white: 0\n- If split: each black triangle contributes 1 (since 0.5*2). So area2 = number of black triangles (0,1,2).\n\nThus we can compute area2 per square as integer 0,1,2.\n\nImplement square_area2(i_mod4,j_mod4):\n\nif s0 even:\n    parity = ...\n    return 2 if parity==0 else 0\nelse:\n    parity1, parity2 as above\n    return (1 if parity1==0 else 0) + (1 if parity2==0 else 0)\n\nNow total_area2 = sum count_i[ri]*count_j[rj]*area2[ri][rj].\n\nAll counts up to 1e9, product up to 1e18 fits 64-bit.\n\nImplement count_i array size 4.\n\nEdge Cases: negative A,B. Mod operation in Python: i%4 yields non-negative remainder. So we can use i_mod = i & 3 for positive? For negative, i & 3 works because two's complement infinite? In Python, -1 & 3 = 3 (since infinite bits). Actually -1 & 3 = 3, -2 &3 =2, etc. That's fine because we want remainder modulo 4 in [0,3] consistent with Python's %.\n\nBut for counting first i with given residue, we can compute using arithmetic with modulo.\n\nSimpler: compute count_i[ri] using formula:\n\ndef count_mod_range(L, R, mod, residue):\n    # count integers x in [L,R] inclusive with x % mod == residue\n    # assume L <= R\n    # compute first = L + ((residue - L) % mod)\n    first = L + ((residue - L) % mod)\n    if first > R:\n        return 0\n    return (R - first)//mod + 1\n\nHere L = A, R = C-1.\n\nSimilarly for j.\n\nNow compute.\n\nComplexities O(16) loops.\n\nTest with sample.\n\nLet's quickly simulate mentally for sample 1: A=0,B=0,C=3,D=3. width=3, height=3. i in {0,1,2}, j in {0,1,2}. Compute area2 per square.\n\nWe can compute quickly maybe code will produce 10.\n\nImplement solve(): read ints, compute area2, print area2.\n\nEdge large numbers: use Python int.\n\nNow produce final code with function solve() and call it.\n\n", "signature": null, "redacted": false}, {"internal": null, "type": "text", "text": "```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve() -> None:\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.read().split())\n    # rectangle includes unit squares with i in [A, C-1], j in [B, D-1]\n    Lx, Rx = A, C - 1\n    Ly, Ry = B, D - 1\n\n    def cnt_mod(L, R, mod, r):\n        \"\"\"count integers x in [L,R] with x % mod == r (0<=r<mod)\"\"\"\n        if L > R:\n            return 0\n        first = L + ((r - L) % mod)\n        if first > R:\n            return 0\n        return (R - first) // mod + 1\n\n    # pre‑compute area2 (twice the black area) for each residue pair (i%4, j%4)\n    area2 = [[0] * 4 for _ in range(4)]\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            i_mod2 = i & 1\n            y_mod2 = (j // 2) & 1          # floor(j/2) mod 2\n            s = i + j\n            if s & 1 == 0:                 # s even, no diagonal cut\n                z_mod2 = (s // 2) & 1\n                parity = (i_mod2 + y_mod2 + z_mod2) & 1\n                area2[i][j] = 2 if parity == 0 else 0\n            else:                          # s odd, diagonal cuts the unit square\n                z1 = ((s - 1) // 2) & 1\n                z2 = ((s + 1) // 2) & 1\n                p1 = (i_mod2 + y_mod2 + z1) & 1\n                p2 = (i_mod2 + y_mod2 + z2) & 1\n                area2[i][j] = (1 if p1 == 0 else 0) + (1 if p2 == 0 else 0)\n\n    # count how many i have each residue modulo 4\n    cnt_i = [cnt_mod(Lx, Rx, 4, r) for r in range(4)]\n    cnt_j = [cnt_mod(Ly, Ry, 4, r) for r in range(4)]\n\n    total_area2 = 0\n    for ri in range(4):\n        if cnt_i[ri] == 0:\n            continue\n        for rj in range(4):\n            if cnt_j[rj] == 0:\n                continue\n            total_area2 += cnt_i[ri] * cnt_j[rj] * area2[ri][rj]\n\n    print(total_area2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "refusal": null}], "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "gpt-oss-120b"}, "stop_reason": "stop", "logprobs": null}], "usage": {"input_tokens": 729, "output_tokens": 6601, "total_tokens": 7330, "input_tokens_cache_write": null, "input_tokens_cache_read": null, "reasoning_tokens": null}, "time": null, "metadata": null, "error": null}, "messages": [{"id": "c93625c4", "content": [{"internal": null, "type": "reasoning", "reasoning": "We need to parse problem: AtCoder wallpaper pattern defined by lines x=n (integer), y=n (even integer), x+y=n (even integer). Regions colored black/white like a checkerboard: adjacent regions across any line have opposite colors. The region containing point (0.5,0.5) is black.\n\nWe need area of black region within axis-aligned rectangle [A,C] x [B,D] (including interior). Output area *2? Wait: they say \"print the area twice\". Actually they say \"print the area two times\". In examples: first example rectangle (0,0)-(3,3). Area of black region is 5, they print 10. So they output 2*area. Second example area 5.5, they print 11. So output is 2*area, which is integer.\n\nThus we need compute 2 * black area within rectangle.\n\nWe need to understand pattern. Let's define coloring function f(x,y) = 0 for white, 1 for black. Adjacent across any line flips. Starting from (0.5,0.5) black.\n\nWe can think of parity of number of lines crossed from (0.5,0.5) to point (x,y). Since lines are of three families: vertical at integer x, horizontal at even y, diagonal x+y = even.\n\nCrossing a line toggles color. So color = parity of count of lines crossed.\n\nThus f(x,y) = ( number of vertical integer lines with x' between 0.5 and x ) + ( number of horizontal even lines between 0.5 and y ) + ( number of diagonal even lines between 0.5 and x+y ) mod 2.\n\nBut we need to handle any real point. For region interior, the color is constant. So we can define for any point (x,y) not on any line, f = ( floor(x) - floor(0.5) )? Actually crossing vertical lines at integer x=n. Starting from 0.5, moving to x, number of integer lines crossed is count of integers n such that between 0.5 and x (exclusive). That's floor(x) - 0 if x>0.5? Let's compute: For x>0.5, integers n with 0.5 < n <= x? Actually crossing when you pass line x=n. Starting at 0.5 (not on line). If x>0.5, you cross each integer n where 0.5 < n <= x. So count = floor(x) - 0 (since smallest integer >0.5 is 1). So count = floor(x) for x>0.5. For x<0.5, you cross integers n where x < n <= 0.5? Actually moving left, crossing lines with n between x and 0.5. Count = number of integers n such that x < n <= 0.5. That's floor(0.5) - floor(x) maybe? floor(0.5)=0. So count = 0 - floor(x) = -floor(x). But need positive count. For negative x, floor(x) is <= x < floor(x)+1. Example x = -0.2, floor = -1. Integers between -0.2 and 0.5 are 0? Actually 0 is > -0.2 and <=0.5, also maybe -0? 0 only. So count =1. floor(0.5)=0, floor(x)=-1, 0 - (-1)=1 correct. So count = floor(0.5) - floor(x) = - floor(x). So general formula: vertical count = floor(x) if x>=0.5 else -floor(x). But that's same as floor(x) - floor(0.5)?? floor(0.5)=0, so vertical count = floor(x) - 0 = floor(x) for x>=0.5, and = -floor(x) for x<0.5. That's not linear.\n\nBetter to define parity using floor of x and maybe sign. Since we only need parity modulo 2, we can use floor(x) mod 2? Let's test: Starting point (0.5,0.5) black. Compute parity contributions: vertical count parity = floor(0.5) =0 (since x>0.5? Actually floor(0.5)=0). Horizontal even lines: y=even integer. Starting y=0.5, count of even integers crossed moving to y: similar count of even n between 0.5 and y. Since even integers are ... -2,0,2,... So count parity depends on floor(y/2) maybe.\n\nDiagonal lines x+y = even integer. Count of even integers between 0.5+0.5=1 and x+y.\n\nThus overall parity maybe expressed as ( floor(x) + floor(y/2) + floor((x+y)/2) ) mod 2? Need to verify.\n\nLet's test with point (0.5,0.5): floor(x)=0, floor(y/2)= floor(0.25)=0, floor((x+y)/2)= floor(1/2)=0 => sum 0 => black (parity 0 maybe black). So define black when sum even.\n\nNow test point (1.5,0.5): Should be opposite color? Let's think: crossing vertical line x=1 (since between 0.5 and 1.5). That's one toggle, so color flips to white. Compute sum: floor(1.5)=1, floor(0.5/2)=0, floor((2)/2)=1 => sum=2 even => black again? That's contradictory. So formula wrong.\n\nLet's compute contributions more carefully.\n\nDefine function g(x) = number of integer vertical lines crossed from 0.5 to x. For x>0.5: g = floor(x) - 0 (since integers >0.5 up to floor(x)). For x<0.5: g = - floor(x) (since floor(x) negative or zero). Actually for x<0.5, integers n with x < n <= 0.5. Since 0.5 not integer, the largest integer <=0.5 is 0. So count = number of integers n with x < n <=0. So that's 0 - floor(x) if floor(x) <=0? Example x=-1.2 floor=-2, integers -1,0? Wait -1 > -1.2 and <=0, also 0. So count=2 = 0 - (-2) =2 correct. So g = - floor(x) for x<0.5.\n\nThus g = floor(x) if x>=0.5 else -floor(x). This equals floor(x) xor? Actually parity of g is floor(x) mod 2 when x>=0.5, and (-floor(x)) mod 2 when x<0.5. Since -floor(x) mod 2 = floor(x) mod 2 (because modulo 2, -a ≡ a). So parity of g is floor(x) mod 2 regardless of side! Good. So vertical contribution parity = floor(x) mod 2.\n\nSimilarly horizontal lines are at even y = 2k. Count of even integers crossed from 0.5 to y. For y>0.5: count = number of even integers n with 0.5 < n <= y. That's floor(y/2) - floor(0.5/2)?? floor(0.5/2)=0. So count = floor(y/2). For y<0.5: count = number of even n with y < n <=0.5. Since 0.5 not even, largest even <=0.5 is 0. So count = 0 - floor(y/2) (where floor(y/2) is integer <= y/2). Example y=-0.2, y/2=-0.1 floor=-1, count =0 - (-1)=1. So parity = floor(y/2) mod 2 (since -floor(y/2) ≡ floor(y/2) mod2). So horizontal contribution parity = floor(y/2) mod 2.\n\nDiagonal lines x+y = even integer 2k. Count from 0.5+0.5=1 to s = x+y. For s>1: count = number of even integers n with 1 < n <= s. That's floor(s/2) - floor(1/2)= floor(s/2) -0 = floor(s/2). For s<1: count = number of even n with s < n <=1. Largest even <=1 is 0. So count = 0 - floor(s/2). Parity = floor(s/2) mod2 again. So diagonal contribution parity = floor((x+y)/2) mod 2.\n\nThus total parity = ( floor(x) + floor(y/2) + floor((x+y)/2) ) mod 2. Black when parity even (0). Let's test earlier point (1.5,0.5): floor(x)=1, floor(y/2)=0, floor((2)/2)=1 => sum=2 even => black, but we expected white. Let's double-check expectation: Starting at (0.5,0.5) black. Move to (1.5,0.5) crossing vertical line x=1 only, so toggle once => white. But also crossing diagonal line? The line x+y = even integer: at start s=1, which is odd, not a line. At end s=2.0, which is even integer line x+y=2. Did we cross that line? The path from (0.5,0.5) to (1.5,0.5) is horizontal line y=0.5, x from 0.5 to 1.5. The line x+y=2 is x+0.5=2 => x=1.5, which is endpoint. Does crossing at endpoint count? Adjacent regions across a line are different; the line itself is boundary. The point (1.5,0.5) lies on the line x+y=2 (since 1.5+0.5=2). But region interior does not include the line. The rectangle interior includes points not on lines. For area calculation, measure zero lines don't affect area. So the region containing (1.5,0.5) is ambiguous; but interior points near (1.5,0.5) with x slightly less than 1.5 have s<2, so they are on one side. So crossing the diagonal line at the endpoint does not affect interior region for points with x<1.5. So the region just left of line is white? Let's evaluate a point (1.4,0.5): floor(x)=1, floor(y/2)=0, floor((1.9)/2)= floor(0.95)=0 => sum=1 odd => white. Good. So our parity formula gives white for points with x<1.5. At x=1.5 exactly, floor(x)=1, floor((2)/2)=1, sum=2 even => black, but that's on the line, not interior. So parity formula works for interior points (excluding lines). So our earlier expectation of white for (1.5,0.5) interior is correct; but point on line is black per formula but irrelevant.\n\nThus black region defined by parity even.\n\nNow we need area of points (x,y) in rectangle where parity even. Since parity depends on floor functions, the region is a union of unit squares (or half-unit?) Actually floor(x) changes at integer x, floor(y/2) changes at y = even integer, floor((x+y)/2) changes at lines x+y = even integer. So pattern repeats with period 2 in both x and y? Let's consider transformation modulo 2.\n\nDefine X = floor(x) mod 2, Y = floor(y/2) mod 2, Z = floor((x+y)/2) mod 2. Parity = X+Y+Z mod2.\n\nWe can consider coordinates modulo 2 for x and y? Since floor(x) mod2 depends on integer part parity. For x in [k, k+1), X = k mod2. So X is constant within each unit vertical strip.\n\nSimilarly Y depends on floor(y/2) parity: y in [2m,2m+2) => floor(y/2)=m, Y = m mod2. So Y constant within strips of height 2.\n\nZ depends on floor((x+y)/2) parity: define s = x+y. For s in [2n,2n+2) => floor(s/2)=n, Z = n mod2. So Z constant within diagonal strips of width sqrt(2) but defined by s.\n\nThus pattern repeats with period 2 in both x and y? Let's test: shift x by 2 changes floor(x) by 2 => X unchanged. Shift y by 2 changes floor(y/2) by 1 => Y flips. Also s shifts by 2 => Z flips. So overall parity may change? Need to see overall periodicity of 4? Might be period 2 in x and 4 in y? But we can compute area analytically using inclusion-exclusion? Might be easier to compute total black area = (area of rectangle) /2? Not exactly because pattern not simple checkerboard due to diagonal lines.\n\nWe can compute using lattice counting: Since pattern defined by parity of linear function of floor values, the black region within any large rectangle may have area = half of total area? Let's test with examples: rectangle (0,0)-(3,3) area 9, black area 5 => not half (4.5). So not equal.\n\nWe need to compute exact area efficiently for coordinates up to 1e9.\n\nWe can treat the plane partitioned into cells where floor(x), floor(y/2), floor((x+y)/2) are constant. These cells are polygons (mostly triangles/quadrilaterals). But maybe we can compute black area as sum over integer lattice points? Since each unit square (x in [i,i+1), y in [j,j+1)) may be partially black due to diagonal lines. However diagonal lines cut across squares.\n\nObservation: lines x+y = even integer are diagonal lines with slope -1, spacing sqrt(2). Within each unit square, the diagonal line may cut it into two triangles. So black area may be half of unit square plus some offset.\n\nMaybe we can compute black area as integral of indicator function: f(x,y) = 1 if parity even else 0. Since parity depends on floor values, we can sum over integer i for x-strip, and within each strip integrate over y.\n\nWe can iterate over integer i from floor(A) to floor(C)-1 (potentially up to 2e9, too many). Need O(1) formula.\n\nWe need to find formula for black area in rectangle aligned to axes. Might be expressed as (area + something)/2 where something depends on boundary parity.\n\nConsider that the pattern is a 2-coloring of the planar graph formed by those lines, which is a periodic tiling with fundamental region maybe a parallelogram of area 2? Let's attempt to find fundamental domain.\n\nTake coordinates modulo 2 in both x and y? Let's sample points in [0,2) x [0,2). Compute black area via brute to see pattern. Let's quickly think: we can write small script but offline mental.\n\nBetter: Since lines are at integer x, even y, even x+y. The lattice generated by vectors (2,0) and (0,2) and (1,-1) maybe? The pattern repeats with period 2 in x and y? Let's test point (x+2, y+2): floor(x+2) = floor(x)+2 => X unchanged. floor((y+2)/2) = floor(y/2 +1) = floor(y/2)+1 => Y flips. floor((x+2 + y+2)/2) = floor((x+y)/2 +2) = floor((x+y)/2)+2 => Z unchanged. So parity changes by Y flip => overall parity flips. So not same.\n\nWhat about shift (2,0): X unchanged, Y unchanged, Z flips (since s+2). So parity flips. Shift (0,2): X unchanged, Y flips, Z flips => parity unchanged (since two flips). So translation (0,2) is symmetry. Similarly (2,0) flips, (2,2) flips? (2,2): X unchanged, Y flips, Z unchanged? s+4 => Z unchanged (since +2 in floor). Actually floor((s+4)/2)= floor(s/2+2)= floor(s/2)+2 => Z unchanged. So parity flips due to Y flip. So not.\n\nThus fundamental domain maybe 4x2 rectangle? Let's test translation (4,0): X unchanged (since +4), Z flips? s+4 => floor(s/2)+2 => Z unchanged. So parity unchanged. So period in x is 4? Wait earlier (2,0) flips, (4,0) unchanged, so period 4.\n\nSimilarly in y: shift (0,4): Y flips twice? floor((y+4)/2)= floor(y/2+2)= floor(y/2)+2 => Y unchanged. Z: s+4 => Z unchanged. So period 4 in y.\n\nThus pattern repeats every 4 in both axes. Let's verify: shift (4,0) leaves parity unchanged, shift (0,4) unchanged, shift (4,4) unchanged. So fundamental domain 4x4.\n\nThus we can compute black area in any rectangle by decomposing into full 4x4 blocks plus remainder edges.\n\nNow we need black area within a 4x4 block. Compute total black area in [0,4) x [0,4). Let's brute think: area = 16, black area maybe 8? Let's test with example rectangle (0,0)-(3,3) gave black area 5 out of 9, not half. For 4x4 maybe not half.\n\nWe can compute by enumerating small grid using code, but we need formula. Let's attempt manual: Since pattern periodic, we can precompute black area for each unit cell of size 1x1 within 4x4, maybe with diagonal cut.\n\nWithin each unit square [i,i+1) x [j,j+1), X = i mod2, Y = floor(j/2) mod2 (since j integer). Z depends on floor((i+j + something)/2). Since x+y in [i+j, i+j+2). The line x+y = even integer may cut square.\n\nWe can compute black area for each square analytically: For given i,j, define parity function p(x,y) = (i + floor(y/2) + floor((x+y)/2)) mod2, where i = floor(x). Since within square, i constant, floor(y/2) constant if j even? Actually y in [j,j+1). floor(y/2) = floor(j/2) because j integer, and j+1 <= j+1 < j+2, so floor(y/2) same as floor(j/2). So Y constant per square.\n\nThus parity depends only on floor((x+y)/2) which may be either floor((i+j)/2) or floor((i+j)/2)+1 depending on whether x+y crosses an even integer boundary within square.\n\nLet s0 = i + j. The even integers are multiples of 2. The interval of x+y within square is [s0, s0+2). So there is at most one even integer boundary at t = next even integer after s0 (if s0 not even) or at s0 (if s0 even) but that's boundary line of square. Since interior excludes boundary, the floor((x+y)/2) is constant within interior of square except when the interval crosses an even integer, i.e., when s0 < even <= s0+2. That occurs when s0 is odd (since then next even is s0+1). So if s0 is odd, then for points where x+y < s0+1, floor((x+y)/2) = floor(s0/2) = (s0-1)/2. For points where x+y > s0+1, floor = (s0+1)/2. The line x+y = s0+1 (even) cuts the square diagonally from (i+1, j) to (i, j+1). So square is split into two right triangles.\n\nThus parity within square is constant on each triangle.\n\nWe can compute black area in square:\n\nLet i_mod2 = i%2, Y = floor(j/2)%2.\n\nCase 1: s0 even => no diagonal cut, floor((x+y)/2) = s0/2 constant. Then parity = i_mod2 + Y + (s0/2 %2) mod2. If parity even => whole square black area =1, else 0.\n\nCase 2: s0 odd => diagonal cut. For lower-left triangle where x+y < s0+1 (i.e., below diagonal), floor = (s0-1)/2. For upper-right triangle where x+y > s0+1, floor = (s0+1)/2.\n\nCompute parity for each triangle: parity1 = i_mod2 + Y + ((s0-1)/2 %2) mod2. parity2 = i_mod2 + Y + ((s0+1)/2 %2) mod2.\n\nEach triangle area = 0.5. So black area contributed = 0.5 * ( (parity1 even) + (parity2 even) ).\n\nThus we can precompute for i in 0..3, j in 0..3.\n\nLet's compute quickly by mental or we can embed in code to compute 4x4 block area. Since we need final code, we can compute this block area programmatically at runtime (constant small loops). Then for large rectangle, compute number of full 4x4 blocks and remainder.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\nGiven A,B,C,D (A<C, B<D). Compute total black area = integrate over rectangle.\n\nWe can define function area_black(x1,y1,x2,y2) where rectangle coordinates are integers? Not necessarily integer boundaries. But A,B,C,D are integers. So rectangle edges align with integer grid lines. Good.\n\nThus rectangle consists of whole unit squares. So we can count per unit square using above method.\n\nThus we can compute total black area as sum over i from A to C-1, j from B to D-1 of black area of unit square (i,j). Since A,B,C,D up to 1e9, need O(1) using periodicity 4.\n\nWe can compute sum over i modulo 4 and j modulo 4 using counts.\n\nLet width = C - A, height = D - B.\n\nWe can compute count of squares for each residue class (i_mod4, j_mod4). For each i in [A, C-1], its residue = (i % 4 + 4) %4. Similarly j.\n\nNumber of i with residue r = floor((C-1 - r0)/4) - floor((A-1 - r0)/4) ??? Simpler: compute first i0 = smallest i >= A with i%4 = r. If i0 > C-1 then count 0 else count = ((C-1 - i0)//4) +1.\n\nSimilarly for j.\n\nThen total black area = sum_{ri,rj} count_i[ri] * count_j[rj] * black_area_per_square(ri, rj).\n\nWhere black_area_per_square returns 0,1,0.5 as per above.\n\nThus we need to compute black_area_per_square for residues modulo 4 (since pattern repeats every 4 in i and j). Indeed i_mod4 determines i_mod2 and also floor(j/2)%2 depends on j_mod4.\n\nCompute function:\n\ndef square_black(i_mod4, j_mod4):\n    i = i_mod4\n    j = j_mod4\n    i_mod2 = i & 1\n    Y = (j//2) & 1  # floor(j/2) mod2\n    s0 = i + j\n    if s0 % 2 == 0:\n        Z = (s0//2) & 1\n        parity = (i_mod2 + Y + Z) & 1\n        return 1.0 if parity == 0 else 0.0\n    else:\n        Z1 = ((s0-1)//2) & 1\n        Z2 = ((s0+1)//2) & 1\n        parity1 = (i_mod2 + Y + Z1) & 1\n        parity2 = (i_mod2 + Y + Z2) & 1\n        return (0.5 if parity1 == 0 else 0.0) + (0.5 if parity2 == 0 else 0.0)\n\nNow compute total black area (as float maybe .5). Then output 2*area as integer. Since area may be .5 increments, 2*area integer.\n\nWe can compute using rational numbers: store area2 = 2 * black area = integer. For each square, area2 contribution is:\n\n- If whole square black: 2\n- If whole white: 0\n- If split: each black triangle contributes 1 (since 0.5*2). So area2 = number of black triangles (0,1,2).\n\nThus we can compute area2 per square as integer 0,1,2.\n\nImplement square_area2(i_mod4,j_mod4):\n\nif s0 even:\n    parity = ...\n    return 2 if parity==0 else 0\nelse:\n    parity1, parity2 as above\n    return (1 if parity1==0 else 0) + (1 if parity2==0 else 0)\n\nNow total_area2 = sum count_i[ri]*count_j[rj]*area2[ri][rj].\n\nAll counts up to 1e9, product up to 1e18 fits 64-bit.\n\nImplement count_i array size 4.\n\nEdge Cases: negative A,B. Mod operation in Python: i%4 yields non-negative remainder. So we can use i_mod = i & 3 for positive? For negative, i & 3 works because two's complement infinite? In Python, -1 & 3 = 3 (since infinite bits). Actually -1 & 3 = 3, -2 &3 =2, etc. That's fine because we want remainder modulo 4 in [0,3] consistent with Python's %.\n\nBut for counting first i with given residue, we can compute using arithmetic with modulo.\n\nSimpler: compute count_i[ri] using formula:\n\ndef count_mod_range(L, R, mod, residue):\n    # count integers x in [L,R] inclusive with x % mod == residue\n    # assume L <= R\n    # compute first = L + ((residue - L) % mod)\n    first = L + ((residue - L) % mod)\n    if first > R:\n        return 0\n    return (R - first)//mod + 1\n\nHere L = A, R = C-1.\n\nSimilarly for j.\n\nNow compute.\n\nComplexities O(16) loops.\n\nTest with sample.\n\nLet's quickly simulate mentally for sample 1: A=0,B=0,C=3,D=3. width=3, height=3. i in {0,1,2}, j in {0,1,2}. Compute area2 per square.\n\nWe can compute quickly maybe code will produce 10.\n\nImplement solve(): read ints, compute area2, print area2.\n\nEdge large numbers: use Python int.\n\nNow produce final code with function solve() and call it.\n\n", "signature": null, "redacted": false}, {"internal": null, "type": "text", "text": "```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve() -> None:\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, sys.stdin.read().split())\n    # rectangle includes unit squares with i in [A, C-1], j in [B, D-1]\n    Lx, Rx = A, C - 1\n    Ly, Ry = B, D - 1\n\n    def cnt_mod(L, R, mod, r):\n        \"\"\"count integers x in [L,R] with x % mod == r (0<=r<mod)\"\"\"\n        if L > R:\n            return 0\n        first = L + ((r - L) % mod)\n        if first > R:\n            return 0\n        return (R - first) // mod + 1\n\n    # pre‑compute area2 (twice the black area) for each residue pair (i%4, j%4)\n    area2 = [[0] * 4 for _ in range(4)]\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            i_mod2 = i & 1\n            y_mod2 = (j // 2) & 1          # floor(j/2) mod 2\n            s = i + j\n            if s & 1 == 0:                 # s even, no diagonal cut\n                z_mod2 = (s // 2) & 1\n                parity = (i_mod2 + y_mod2 + z_mod2) & 1\n                area2[i][j] = 2 if parity == 0 else 0\n            else:                          # s odd, diagonal cuts the unit square\n                z1 = ((s - 1) // 2) & 1\n                z2 = ((s + 1) // 2) & 1\n                p1 = (i_mod2 + y_mod2 + z1) & 1\n                p2 = (i_mod2 + y_mod2 + z2) & 1\n                area2[i][j] = (1 if p1 == 0 else 0) + (1 if p2 == 0 else 0)\n\n    # count how many i have each residue modulo 4\n    cnt_i = [cnt_mod(Lx, Rx, 4, r) for r in range(4)]\n    cnt_j = [cnt_mod(Ly, Ry, 4, r) for r in range(4)]\n\n    total_area2 = 0\n    for ri in range(4):\n        if cnt_i[ri] == 0:\n            continue\n        for rj in range(4):\n            if cnt_j[rj] == 0:\n                continue\n            total_area2 += cnt_i[ri] * cnt_j[rj] * area2[ri][rj]\n\n    print(total_area2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "refusal": null}], "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "gpt-oss-120b"}], "metadata": {"task_id": "abc354_d", "question_title": "วอลล์เปเปอร์ AtCoder", "test_cases": [{"input": "0 0 3 3\n", "output": "10\n", "testtype": "stdin"}, {"input": "-1 -2 1 3\n", "output": "11\n", "testtype": "stdin"}, {"input": "-1000000000 -1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n", "output": "4000000000000000000\n", "testtype": "stdin"}], "public_test_cases": [{"input": "0 0 3 3\n", "output": "10\n", "testtype": "stdin"}, {"input": "-1 -2 1 3\n", "output": "11\n", "testtype": "stdin"}, {"input": "-1000000000 -1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n", "output": "4000000000000000000\n", "testtype": "stdin"}], "private_test_cases": [], "difficulty": "hard", "starter_code": "", "requires_stdin": true}}

All elements positive integers. The bitwise AND of all elements = x. Want minimal possible max element.\n\nWe need to find minimal possible largest element given constraints.\n\nObservation: For AND of all numbers to be x, each bit that is 1 in x must be 1 in every number. Bits that are 0 in x can be 0 in at least one number (maybe more). To minimize max, we want numbers as small as possible.\n\nWe need n distinct increasing numbers all having at least bits of x set. So each number = x plus possibly extra bits (where x has 0). The extra bits can differ among numbers to make them distinct and increasing.\n\nGoal: minimize the largest number.\n\nWe can think of constructing the smallest n numbers >= x (since must have bits of x) that are strictly increasing and have AND = x. However, if we just take the first n numbers >= x that have all bits of x set, will their AND be x? Possibly higher if some extra bits are common across all numbers. To ensure AND = x, we need that for each bit where x has 0, there exists at least one number where that bit is 0. So we must ensure that no extra bit is set in all numbers.\n\nThus we need to assign extra bits across numbers such that each extra bit is missing in at least one number.\n\nGoal: minimize max.\n\nStrategy: Use numbers: start with base = x. Then we need n-1 additional distinct numbers > base. We can add bits gradually.\n\nSimplify: Since n up to 1e8, but we just need compute result formulaically, not generate array.\n\nWe need minimal possible max value M.\n\nWe can think of constructing numbers as: For i from 0 to n-1, nums[i] = x | i (or something). But need strictly increasing and AND = x. If we set nums[i] = x + i (i.e., x + i), does AND equal x? Not necessarily because adding i may set bits that could be common across all numbers. Example: x=4 (100), n=3. x+0=4 (100), x+1=5 (101), x+2=6 (110). AND = 100 = 4. Works. For x=7 (111), n=2: numbers 7 (111), 8 (1000)?? Wait x+1=8 (1000) does not have bits 0-2 set, so AND would be 0. Not allowed because each number must have bits of x set. So we cannot just add i.\n\nWe need each number to have all bits of x set. So numbers must be of form x plus some combination of bits where x has 0. So we can think of adding a mask m where m & x == 0.\n\nThus each number = x | m_i, with m_i subset of complement bits.\n\nWe need n distinct m_i (including possibly 0) such that AND over (x | m_i) = x. That means for each bit b where x has 0, there exists at least one i with m_i having 0 at that bit. Equivalent: the bitwise AND of all m_i is 0.\n\nThus we need n distinct masks (including 0) with AND = 0, minimize max (x | m_max). Since x is fixed, minimizing max is minimizing max mask.\n\nThus problem reduces to: given n, find minimal possible maximum mask value M_mask such that there exist n distinct masks (non-negative integers) each with bits only from positions where x has 0, AND of all masks = 0, and max mask = M_mask. Then answer = x | M_mask.\n\nWe can treat bits independently. To minimize max mask, we want to use low-order bits first.\n\nObservation: The set of masks can be taken as numbers from 0 to n-1 (in binary) as long as we have enough bits (i.e., the bits used are within allowed positions). Since we can use any bits where x has 0, we can map the binary representation of numbers 0..n-1 onto those positions.\n\nIf we have k zero bits in x (i.e., positions where x has 0). Then we can represent up to 2^k distinct masks. Since n can be up to 1e8, but x up to 1e8 (bits up to 27). So k could be up to 27. 2^k may be less than n, but constraints guarantee n <= 1e8, but not guarantee feasible? The problem likely assumes solution always exists because we can always increase numbers arbitrarily by using higher bits beyond current range (since we can use any bits beyond the highest bit of x). Actually bits beyond the highest set bit of x are also zero in x, so they are allowed. So we have infinite zero bits (since integers unbounded). So we can always find enough distinct masks.\n\nThus we can think of using the lowest k bits (starting from LSB) to encode numbers 0..n-1. The maximum mask will be the highest number among those masks, which is n-1 (if we use contiguous range). However, we must ensure that the bits used are allowed (i.e., positions where x has 0). Since we can also use bits beyond the highest bit of x, we can always map the binary representation of n-1 onto some allowed positions. The minimal max mask would be the smallest integer M such that there are at least n distinct masks <= M with AND = 0. But using masks 0..n-1 gives AND = 0? Not always. For example, masks 0,1,2 have AND = 0? 0 & 1 & 2 = 0, yes because 0 present ensures AND zero. In general, if we include mask 0, the AND of all masks is 0 regardless of others. Since we need distinct masks, we can always include 0 as one mask. So condition satisfied.\n\nThus we can simply take masks = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1. Their max mask = n-1. Then answer = x | (n-1). But need to ensure that for each mask, bits set are only where x has 0. However, mask may have bits where x has 1, which would cause those bits to be set in x|mask (still 1) but that's okay because x already has 1 there. Actually if mask has a bit where x has 1, then x|mask still 1, no issue. But does that affect AND? Since all numbers already have that bit 1 (from x), adding extra 1 doesn't change. So mask can have bits anywhere; the only requirement is that each number must have at least bits of x set, which is satisfied by x|mask. So mask can have bits overlapping with x's 1 bits; that's fine. So we can just use masks 0..n-1.\n\nThus minimal max = x | (n-1). But is this always minimal? Let's test examples: n=3, x=4 (100). n-1=2 (010). x|2 = 110 = 6. matches example. n=2, x=7 (111). n-1=1 (001). x|1 = 111 = 7, but example answer is 15. Wait discrepancy. Let's compute: x=7 (111), n=2. Using masks 0 and 1: numbers = 7|0=7, 7|1=7 (since bit already set). Actually 7|1 = 7, same as first, not distinct. Need distinct numbers. Since mask 1 adds bit 0 which is already 1, no change. So numbers not distinct. So we need distinct numbers, so masks must produce distinct x|mask values. If mask only sets bits already set in x, the result doesn't change. So we need masks that add at least one new bit beyond x's 1 bits to make numbers distinct.\n\nThus we need n distinct numbers > = x, each with x bits set, and distinct. So we need at least n-1 masks that have at least one bit outside x's 1 bits. So using masks 0..n-1 may not give distinct numbers if x has low bits set.\n\nWe need to ensure that the masks produce distinct x|mask values. Equivalent to masks being distinct after ignoring bits where x has 1 (since those bits don't affect result). So we need at least n distinct masks when projected onto complement bits of x.\n\nThus we need to consider only bits where x has 0 (including higher bits). Let’s denote positions of zero bits as list. We need to assign distinct subsets of these positions to each number (including empty set for first). So we need at least n distinct subsets, i.e., need at least k bits where 2^k >= n. Minimal k = ceil(log2 n). Then we can use masks that set bits only in those k zero positions, using numbers 0..n-1 mapped onto those positions. The maximum mask value will be the mask where bits correspond to binary representation of n-1 placed in those positions. To minimize the numeric value, we should use the lowest zero bit positions (least significant) to encode bits. That yields minimal max mask = sum_{j where bit j of (n-1) is 1} (1 << zero_pos_j). Where zero_pos_j is the j-th zero bit position (starting from LSB zero bits). So answer = x | that mask.\n\nThus algorithm: find positions of zero bits in x (including beyond current highest bit). We need at least k = ceil(log2 n) zero positions. We'll take the first k zero positions (starting from bit 0 upward). For each bit j (0-indexed) of (n-1), if that bit is 1, set the corresponding zero position bit in mask.\n\nImplementation steps:\n\n- If n == 1: need only one number, AND must be x, minimal max = x (array [x]). Return x.\n\n- Else:\n    - need bits_needed = ceil(log2 n). Compute bits_needed = n-1 bit length (i.e., (n-1).bit_length()).\n    - Iterate over bit positions i = 0,1,..., collect zero positions where ((x >> i) & 1) == 0, until we have bits_needed positions. Also if not enough within some range, continue beyond current max bit (where x bits are 0 by default). So just keep i increasing.\n    - Build mask = 0.\n    - For j from 0 to bits_needed-1:\n        if ((n-1) >> j) & 1:\n            mask |= (1 << zero_positions[j])\n    - answer = x | mask\n    - return answer\n\nTest example 2: n=2, x=7 (111). bits_needed = (2-1).bit_length() = 1. Need 1 zero position. Scan bits: bit0 is 1, bit1 is1, bit2 is1, bit3 is0 => zero_positions[0]=3. n-1 =1 => binary 1 at j=0 => set mask bit at position 3 => mask = 1<<3 =8. answer = 7|8 =15. matches.\n\nExample 1: n=3, x=4 (100). bits_needed = (3-1).bit_length() = (2).bit_length() =2. Need 2 zero positions. Scan bits: bit0 zero, bit1 zero, bit2 is1, so zero_positions = [0,1]. n-1=2 (10). j=1 set => mask add 1<<zero_positions[1]=1<<1=2. answer = 4|2=6. matches.\n\nEdge: n=1 => answer x.\n\nCheck larger n: Suppose x=0, n=5. bits_needed = (4).bit_length()=3. zero_positions are bits 0,1,2,... first three are 0,1,2. n-1=4 (100). So mask = 1<<zero_positions[2]=1<<2=4. answer = 0|4=4. Let's see if possible: need 5 distinct numbers with AND 0. We can use numbers: 0,1,2,3,4? But need positive integers? Problem says array of positive integers. 0 not allowed. So we need all >0. Our construction uses mask 0 for first number => x|0 = 0, not positive. So need to ensure all numbers positive. Since x could be 0, we cannot have 0. So we need to adjust: we must have all nums positive. So we need to avoid mask 0 if x==0? Actually if x>0, x|0 = x >0, fine. If x==0, need first number >0, so mask cannot be 0. So we need to shift all masks by at least 1? We need n distinct positive numbers with AND 0. Minimal max? For x=0, we can use numbers 1,2,...,n? Their AND may be 0? Not always. For n=2, numbers 1 (01) and 2 (10) AND =0, max=2. Our formula with bits_needed = (n-1).bit_length() and zero_positions starting from bit0 would give mask = (n-1) placed, answer = mask. For n=5, mask = 4, answer=4. But we need 5 distinct positive numbers with AND 0 and max 4. Is that possible? Numbers must be <=4, distinct, positive: {1,2,3,4}? That's only 4 numbers, need 5. So impossible. So our construction fails for x=0 because we need n distinct numbers >0, and we only have n masks (including 0) but 0 not allowed. So we need to ensure all numbers >0. For x>0, fine. For x=0, we need to avoid mask 0, i.e., we need n distinct non-zero masks. So we need at least n distinct non-zero masks with AND 0. The minimal max mask then would be the smallest integer M such that there are at least n distinct numbers in [1, M] whose AND is 0. Since we can include 0? Not allowed. So we need to consider.\n\nSimplify: For x=0, we can use masks 1..n (or 1..n). But need AND of all numbers =0. If we include numbers 1..n, AND may not be 0 for some n. However, we can ensure by including a power of two that is not shared. The minimal max likely is the smallest M such that we can pick n distinct positive integers <=M with AND 0. I think the optimal is to use numbers 1,2,4,8,... (powers of two) and maybe extra numbers as needed. The max would be the smallest power of two >= n? Actually using powers of two gives AND 0 because each has distinct single bit, AND across all is 0. Need n numbers, so need n distinct powers of two, max = 2^{n-1}, huge. Not minimal.\n\nBetter: Use numbers 1..n, does AND become 0 for n>=2? For n=2, 1&2=0. For n=3, 1&2&3 = (1&2)=0 &3 =0. So for any n>=2, AND of 1..n is 0 because among them there is a number with LSB 0 (even) and a number with LSB 1, etc. Actually AND of consecutive numbers from 1 to n is 0 for n>=2. So we can use numbers 1..n, max = n. So answer for x=0 is n. Let's test n=5 => max=5. Our earlier formula gave 4, which is too low because we need positive numbers. So answer should be max(n, something). Let's verify: numbers 1..5 AND = 1&2=0, 0&3=0, etc =>0. So max=5 works. Could we do max=4? Need 5 distinct positive numbers <=4 impossible. So minimal max = n for x=0. So answer = max(n, x | mask) but x=0 => mask = something. Our mask gave n-1, which is less than n for n>1. So we need to adjust for x=0 case: answer = n (since we can use 1..n). Is that always minimal? Yes because need n distinct positive integers, smallest max is n (pigeonhole). And AND of 1..n is 0 for n>=2. For n=1, answer =0? But positive integer required, but x=0, n=1, need array of size 1 with AND 0, positive integer? The only positive integer with AND 0 is impossible because any positive integer has at least one bit 1, so AND would be that number >0. So maybe constraints guarantee n>=2 when x=0? Not specified. We'll handle: if n==1, answer = x (which could be 0). But positive integer requirement contradictory; ignore.\n\nThus final algorithm:\n\nif n==1: return x\n\nif x==0:\n    return n  # because we can use 1..n\n\nelse:\n    bits_needed = (n-1).bit_length()\n    zero_positions = []\n    i=0\n    while len(zero_positions) < bits_needed:\n        if ((x>>i)&1)==0:\n            zero_positions.append(i)\n        i+=1\n    mask=0\n    for j in range(bits_needed):\n        if ((n-1)>>j)&1:\n            mask |= (1<<zero_positions[j])\n    return x | mask\n\nTest: n=2, x=7 => bits_needed=1, zero_positions=[3], mask=8, answer=15.\n\nn=3, x=4 => bits_needed=2, zero_positions=[0,1], mask=2, answer=6.\n\nEdge: n=5, x=0 => returns 5.\n\nEdge: n=5, x=2 (10). bits_needed= (4).bit_length()=3. zero_positions: bits where x has 0: bit0, bit2, bit3,... first three: [0,2,3]. n-1=4 (100). j=2 set => mask add 1<<zero_positions[2]=1<<3=8. answer = 2|8=10. Let's see if possible: need 5 numbers >0 with AND =2. Our construction would be masks: 0,1,2,4,8? Actually we only used up to mask 8. The numbers would be x|mask_i where mask_i are subsets of zero positions representing numbers 0..4. Represent 0..4 in binary using zero positions: 0->0,1->bit0 => mask 1<<0=1,2->bit2 => mask 1<<2=4,3->bits0+2 => mask 1+4=5,4->bit3 => mask 8. Numbers: 2,3,6,7,10. Max=10 matches answer. AND of these numbers? Compute: 2 (010),3(011),6(110),7(111),10(1010). AND = 2? Let's compute: 2&3=2, 2&6=2, 2&7=2, 2&10=2 (010 &1010 = 0010).

All elements positive integers. The bitwise AND of all elements = x. Want minimal possible max element.\n\nWe need to find minimal possible largest element given constraints.\n\nObservation: For AND of all numbers to be x, each bit that is 1 in x must be 1 in every number. Bits that are 0 in x can be 0 in at least one number (maybe more). To minimize max, we want numbers as small as possible.\n\nWe need n distinct increasing numbers all having at least bits of x set. So each number = x plus possibly extra bits (where x has 0). The extra bits can differ among numbers to make them distinct and increasing.\n\nGoal: minimize the largest number.\n\nWe can think of constructing the smallest n numbers >= x (since must have bits of x) that are strictly increasing and have AND = x. However, if we just take the first n numbers >= x that have all bits of x set, will their AND be x? Possibly higher if some extra bits are common across all numbers. To ensure AND = x, we need that for each bit where x has 0, there exists at least one number where that bit is 0. So we must ensure that no extra bit is set in all numbers.\n\nThus we need to assign extra bits across numbers such that each extra bit is missing in at least one number.\n\nGoal: minimize max.\n\nStrategy: Use numbers: start with base = x. Then we need n-1 additional distinct numbers > base. We can add bits gradually.\n\nSimplify: Since n up to 1e8, but we just need compute result formulaically, not generate array.\n\nWe need minimal possible max value M.\n\nWe can think of constructing numbers as: For i from 0 to n-1, nums[i] = x | i (or something). But need strictly increasing and AND = x. If we set nums[i] = x + i (i.e., x + i), does AND equal x? Not necessarily because adding i may set bits that could be common across all numbers. Example: x=4 (100), n=3. x+0=4 (100), x+1=5 (101), x+2=6 (110). AND = 100 = 4. Works. For x=7 (111), n=2: numbers 7 (111), 8 (1000)?? Wait x+1=8 (1000) does not have bits 0-2 set, so AND would be 0. Not allowed because each number must have bits of x set. So we cannot just add i.\n\nWe need each number to have all bits of x set. So numbers must be of form x plus some combination of bits where x has 0. So we can think of adding a mask m where m & x == 0.\n\nThus each number = x | m_i, with m_i subset of complement bits.\n\nWe need n distinct m_i (including possibly 0) such that AND over (x | m_i) = x. That means for each bit b where x has 0, there exists at least one i with m_i having 0 at that bit. Equivalent: the bitwise AND of all m_i is 0.\n\nThus we need n distinct masks (including 0) with AND = 0, minimize max (x | m_max). Since x is fixed, minimizing max is minimizing max mask.\n\nThus problem reduces to: given n, find minimal possible maximum mask value M_mask such that there exist n distinct masks (non-negative integers) each with bits only from positions where x has 0, AND of all masks = 0, and max mask = M_mask. Then answer = x | M_mask.\n\nWe can treat bits independently. To minimize max mask, we want to use low-order bits first.\n\nObservation: The set of masks can be taken as numbers from 0 to n-1 (in binary) as long as we have enough bits (i.e., the bits used are within allowed positions). Since we can use any bits where x has 0, we can map the binary representation of numbers 0..n-1 onto those positions.\n\nIf we have k zero bits in x (i.e., positions where x has 0). Then we can represent up to 2^k distinct masks. Since n can be up to 1e8, but x up to 1e8 (bits up to 27). So k could be up to 27. 2^k may be less than n, but constraints guarantee n <= 1e8, but not guarantee feasible? The problem likely assumes solution always exists because we can always increase numbers arbitrarily by using higher bits beyond current range (since we can use any bits beyond the highest bit of x). Actually bits beyond the highest set bit of x are also zero in x, so they are allowed. So we have infinite zero bits (since integers unbounded). So we can always find enough distinct masks.\n\nThus we can think of using the lowest k bits (starting from LSB) to encode numbers 0..n-1. The maximum mask will be the highest number among those masks, which is n-1 (if we use contiguous range). However, we must ensure that the bits used are allowed (i.e., positions where x has 0). Since we can also use bits beyond the highest bit of x, we can always map the binary representation of n-1 onto some allowed positions. The minimal max mask would be the smallest integer M such that there are at least n distinct masks <= M with AND = 0. But using masks 0..n-1 gives AND = 0? Not always. For example, masks 0,1,2 have AND = 0? 0 & 1 & 2 = 0, yes because 0 present ensures AND zero. In general, if we include mask 0, the AND of all masks is 0 regardless of others. Since we need distinct masks, we can always include 0 as one mask. So condition satisfied.\n\nThus we can simply take masks = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1. Their max mask = n-1. Then answer = x | (n-1). But need to ensure that for each mask, bits set are only where x has 0. However, mask may have bits where x has 1, which would cause those bits to be set in x|mask (still 1) but that's okay because x already has 1 there. Actually if mask has a bit where x has 1, then x|mask still 1, no issue. But does that affect AND? Since all numbers already have that bit 1 (from x), adding extra 1 doesn't change. So mask can have bits anywhere; the only requirement is that each number must have at least bits of x set, which is satisfied by x|mask. So mask can have bits overlapping with x's 1 bits; that's fine. So we can just use masks 0..n-1.\n\nThus minimal max = x | (n-1). But is this always minimal? Let's test examples: n=3, x=4 (100). n-1=2 (010). x|2 = 110 = 6. matches example. n=2, x=7 (111). n-1=1 (001). x|1 = 111 = 7, but example answer is 15. Wait discrepancy. Let's compute: x=7 (111), n=2. Using masks 0 and 1: numbers = 7|0=7, 7|1=7 (since bit already set). Actually 7|1 = 7, same as first, not distinct. Need distinct numbers. Since mask 1 adds bit 0 which is already 1, no change. So numbers not distinct. So we need distinct numbers, so masks must produce distinct x|mask values. If mask only sets bits already set in x, the result doesn't change. So we need masks that add at least one new bit beyond x's 1 bits to make numbers distinct.\n\nThus we need n distinct numbers > = x, each with x bits set, and distinct. So we need at least n-1 masks that have at least one bit outside x's 1 bits. So using masks 0..n-1 may not give distinct numbers if x has low bits set.\n\nWe need to ensure that the masks produce distinct x|mask values. Equivalent to masks being distinct after ignoring bits where x has 1 (since those bits don't affect result). So we need at least n distinct masks when projected onto complement bits of x.\n\nThus we need to consider only bits where x has 0 (including higher bits). Let’s denote positions of zero bits as list. We need to assign distinct subsets of these positions to each number (including empty set for first). So we need at least n distinct subsets, i.e., need at least k bits where 2^k >= n. Minimal k = ceil(log2 n). Then we can use masks that set bits only in those k zero positions, using numbers 0..n-1 mapped onto those positions. The maximum mask value will be the mask where bits correspond to binary representation of n-1 placed in those positions. To minimize the numeric value, we should use the lowest zero bit positions (least significant) to encode bits. That yields minimal max mask = sum_{j where bit j of (n-1) is 1} (1 << zero_pos_j). Where zero_pos_j is the j-th zero bit position (starting from LSB zero bits). So answer = x | that mask.\n\nThus algorithm: find positions of zero bits in x (including beyond current highest bit). We need at least k = ceil(log2 n) zero positions. We'll take the first k zero positions (starting from bit 0 upward). For each bit j (0-indexed) of (n-1), if that bit is 1, set the corresponding zero position bit in mask.\n\nImplementation steps:\n\n- If n == 1: need only one number, AND must be x, minimal max = x (array [x]). Return x.\n\n- Else:\n    - need bits_needed = ceil(log2 n).

Also if not enough within some range, continue beyond current max bit (where x bits are 0 by default). So just keep i increasing.\n    - Build mask = 0.\n    - For j from 0 to bits_needed-1:\n        if ((n-1) >> j) & 1:\n            mask |= (1 << zero_positions[j])\n    - answer = x | mask\n    - return answer\n\nTest example 2: n=2, x=7 (111). bits_needed = (2-1).bit_length() = 1.

Problem says array of positive integers. 0 not allowed. So we need all >0. Our construction uses mask 0 for first number => x|0 = 0, not positive. So need to ensure all numbers positive. Since x could be 0, we cannot have 0. So we need to adjust: we must have all nums positive. So we need to avoid mask 0 if x==0? Actually if x>0, x|0 = x >0, fine. If x==0, need first number >0, so mask cannot be 0. So we need to shift all masks by at least 1? We need n distinct positive numbers with AND 0. Minimal max? For x=0, we can use numbers 1,2,...,n? Their AND may be 0? Not always. For n=2, numbers 1 (01) and 2 (10) AND =0, max=2.

But we need 5 distinct positive numbers with AND 0 and max 4. Is that possible? Numbers must be <=4, distinct, positive: {1,2,3,4}? That's only 4 numbers, need 5. So impossible.

Let's restate:\n\nWe have infinite staircase steps numbered from 0 upward. Alice starts at step 1 with a \"jump\" value initially 0. She wants to reach step k (non-negative integer). She can perform operations repeatedly. If she is at step i, she can:\n\n- Move down to step i-1. This operation cannot be used consecutively (i.e., cannot do two down moves in a row) and cannot be used when at step 0 (since can't go below 0).\n\n- Move up to step i + 2^{jump}. After this move, jump becomes jump + 1.\n\nGoal: count total number of ways Alice can reach step k. She may reach step k multiple times (i.e., sequences that visit k multiple times count as distinct ways? The phrase: \"Alice may reach step k and perform some operations to reach step k again.\" So sequences that end at k after any number of steps, possibly having visited k earlier, are counted.\n\nEssentially count number of sequences of moves starting from (position=1, jump=0) that end at position=k at any time (the final state is at k, any jump value). The sequence can be arbitrarily long, but we need to count all possible sequences? That seems infinite unless constraints limit. However maybe due to constraints of moves, there are only finite ways to reach a given k because jumps increase each time you go up, making steps larger, and you cannot go down consecutively, limiting loops. Might still be infinite? Let's test small k: given examples: k=0 output 2. They list 2 ways? Actually they list maybe 2 distinct sequences? They seem to list more but maybe duplicates.\n\nk=1 output 4.\n\nWe need to derive formula.\n\nLet's think: The state is (position, jump, last_move_was_down?) because down cannot be consecutive. So we need to track whether previous move was down.\n\nWe need to count number of sequences that end at position k, regardless of jump and last move? Probably any.\n\nBut infinite sequences could loop: e.g., up then down then up then down etc. However down cannot be consecutive, but you can alternate up and down. Up moves increase jump each time, making upward steps larger each time, so you cannot return to same position after many cycles because up steps get larger. However you could go up a large step then down 1, then up larger, etc. Could you loop infinitely without exceeding k? Since up steps increase exponentially (2^{jump}), they quickly become huge, so you cannot stay bounded. So number of sequences that end at k is finite.\n\nWe can think of generating all sequences where the up steps are of sizes 1,2,4,8,... (powers of two) in order, each used at most once (since jump increments). So the sequence of up moves is a prefix of powers of two: you may use up moves of sizes 2^0,2^1,... up to some max J-1, each at most once, in order. Between up moves you may insert optional down moves (size 1) but not two consecutive downs.\n\nThus a path is defined by a sequence of actions: for each jump index j from 0 upward, you may decide to do an up move of size 2^j at some point (must be in order). Between up moves you may optionally do a down move (but not two). Also you could start with a down move from step 1 to 0 (since start at 1). That's allowed as first move (since previous not down). After that you cannot do another down immediately.\n\nGoal: final position = k.\n\nWe can model as: start pos=1, jump=0, last_was_down=False. At each step, you can either up (size 2^{jump}) -> pos+=size, jump+=1, last_was_down=False; or down (if pos>0 and not last_was_down) -> pos-=1, last_was_down=True.\n\nWe need count of sequences ending at pos=k (any jump, any last_was_down flag). Since jumps only increase, max jump is limited because pos cannot exceed some bound? Actually you could go arbitrarily high then down many times (but only one down per up). Since each up adds huge amount, you cannot later come back down to small k after many ups because you can only subtract 1 per down, and you cannot have consecutive downs, so after each up you can at most subtract 1 before next up. So net increase after each up-down pair is (2^j -1). So after many steps, position grows roughly sum of (2^j -1) = (2^{J} -1) - J. So grows exponentially. So to reach a given k, you cannot have too many up moves. So finite.\n\nThus we can DP over jump index and position up to k maybe plus some overshoot? But up moves can overshoot beyond k then later down steps may bring back down to k. Since each up adds at least 1, overshoot may be limited because you can only subtract 1 per subsequent up. So overshoot cannot exceed number of remaining up moves. So we can bound position to <= k + max_remaining_ups. Since max remaining ups is limited.\n\nSimpler: we can treat this as counting sequences of length up to J where J is such that sum_{j=0}^{J-1} 2^j = 2^J -1 >= k+something. Since after J up moves, position minimal (if you do a down after each up) is start 1 + sum (2^j -1) = 1 + (2^J -1) - J = 2^J - J. That's still >= k for J large. So we can bound J up to about log2(k+J). So J <= ~log2(k)+2.\n\nThus we can DP over (j, pos, last_down) where j is current jump index (next up size = 2^j). Starting state (j=0, pos=1, last_down=False). Transitions: up -> (j+1, pos+2^j, False). down -> if pos>0 and not last_down -> (j, pos-1, True). Count ways to reach pos=k at any state (any j, any last_down). Since state space small (j up to ~log2(k)+something, pos up to maybe k+J). That's manageable for k up to 1e9? log2(1e9) ~30. pos up to maybe k+30 ~ 1e9+30 which is too large for DP array. Need smarter combinatorial formula.\n\nWe need to count number of sequences leading to k. Observing that down moves only subtract 1 and cannot be consecutive, they essentially can be placed in gaps between up moves, at most one per gap, and possibly before first up (since start at pos=1). Also you could end with a down after last up? Yes, you can end with down as long as not consecutive.\n\nThus each up move corresponds to a \"slot\" where you may optionally insert a down before it (except you cannot have two downs in a row, but since up resets, you can have at most one down between ups). Also you may have a down after the last up (i.e., final move could be down). Also you could start with a down before any up (since start pos=1). So essentially sequence is: optional initial down, then for each up j=0..J-1: up, optionally a down after it (except maybe after last up you could also have down). Wait ordering: you can down before up only if previous move not down. Starting state last not down, so you can down first. After a down, you must up next (since cannot down again). So pattern is alternating down and up, starting possibly with down or up, but never two downs.\n\nThus the sequence is an alternating sequence of moves, where up moves are in increasing power order, and down moves are interleaved at most one between ups, and possibly after the last up.\n\nThus we can represent a sequence by a binary string of length L where 1=up,0=down, with constraint no two 0s, and the up positions correspond to successive powers.\n\nLet J be number of up moves performed. Then there are J up moves, and there can be at most J+1 down moves (including possibly before first up and after last up). But due to no consecutive downs, the number of down moves D can be either J (if start with up and end with up) or J+1 (if start with down and end with down) or J (if start with up and end with down) etc. Actually pattern must alternate, so sequence length = J + D, and they alternate, so |J - D| <=1. Also cannot start with down? It can. So D can be J or J+1 or J-1? If start with up and end with up, D = J-1 (since between ups there are J-1 gaps). If start with up and end with down, D = J (extra down after last up). If start with down and end with up, D = J (down before first up). If start with down and end with down, D = J+1.\n\nThus D can be J-1, J, or J+1, but D >=0.\n\nNow compute final position: start at 1. Each up adds 2^{j} (j from 0 to J-1). Each down subtracts 1. So final position = 1 + sum_{j=0}^{J-1} 2^{j} - D = 1 + (2^{J} -1) - D = 2^{J} - D.\n\nThus we need 2^{J} - D = k => D = 2^{J} - k.\n\nSince D must be non-negative integer and satisfy constraints relative to J: D ∈ {J-1, J, J+1} (and also D >=0). Also D cannot exceed J+1.\n\nThus we need to count number of J such that D = 2^{J} - k is in {J-1, J, J+1} and D >=0.\n\nFor each such J, we need to count number of sequences (alternating patterns) that have exactly J up moves and D down moves, respecting alternation constraints.\n\nGiven J up moves and D down moves, with no two downs consecutive, the number of alternating sequences is determined by whether it starts with up or down.\n\nIf D = J-1: must start and end with up, pattern: up, (down, up) repeated J-1 times. Only 1 sequence.\n\nIf D = J: two possibilities: start with up, end with down; or start with down, end with up. Both are valid alternating sequences. So 2 sequences.\n\nIf D = J+1: must start and end with down, pattern: down, up, down, up,... ending with down. Only 1 sequence.\n\nThus number of sequences for given (J,D) is:\n- 1 if D = J-1 or D = J+1\n- 2 if D = J\n\nEdge cases: J=0? No up moves. Then sum up =0, final position = 1 - D = k => D = 1 - k. But D must be non-negative and <=1? Since with zero up moves, you cannot have any down because you start at step 1, you could do a down to 0 (one down). But you cannot have two downs consecutively, but with zero up moves you cannot have any up to separate. So max D =1. So D can be 0 (no moves) or 1 (single down). Let's see formula: D = 2^{0} - k = 1 - k. So k can be 0 or 1. For k=0, D=1 => D=J+1 (since J=0) => 1 sequence (down). But example says k=0 output 2. Wait they counted 2 ways. Let's examine: Starting at step 1, to reach 0 you can either: down (single down) OR up 2^0=1 to step 2 then down to 1 then down? Actually they described 2 ways: maybe they consider sequences that may include up then down etc. Let's compute using our model: J could be 1? If J=1, then D = 2^1 - k = 2 - 0 =2. D must be in {J-1=0, J=1, J+1=2}. D=2 matches J+1, so valid. Number of sequences for D=J+1 is 1. So total ways = for J=0 (1 way) + J=1 (1 way) =2. That matches example.\n\nSimilarly for k=1: compute possibilities.\nJ=0: D = 1 -1 =0 => D=J => sequences=2? Wait for J=0, D=0, D=J => sequences count? Our earlier rule for J=0 maybe special. With J=0, D=0 means no moves, start at 1, already at k=1, that's a valid way (do nothing). That's 1 way. But also maybe start with up then down? Let's compute J=1: D = 2 -1 =1 => D=J => sequences=2. J=2: D =4 -1 =3, J=2 => D=J+1? J+1=3, yes D=J+1 => sequences=1. Total ways = 1+2+1=4 matches example. Good.\n\nThus formula works.\n\nSo algorithm: iterate J from 0 up to while 2^J - (J+1) <= k? Actually D = 2^J - k must be >=0 and <= J+1. So condition: 0 <= 2^J - k <= J+1 => k <= 2^J <= k + J+1.\n\nThus J such that 2^J is in [k, k+J+1].\n\nSince 2^J grows fast, J up to about log2(k)+1. For k up to 1e9, J up to 31 maybe 32.\n\nWe can loop J from 0 to 60 (since 2^60 > 1e18). For each J compute D = 2^J - k. If D<0 continue. If D > J+1 continue. Then count ways: if D == J: add 2; else (D == J-1 or D == J+1) add 1. Edge case J=0: need to ensure counts correct: For J=0, possible D values: 0 or 1. D=0 => D=J => we earlier said sequences=2? But from earlier reasoning, with J=0, D=0 corresponds to empty sequence (do nothing). That's 1 way, not 2. Our generic rule gives 2, which would be wrong. Let's test: For k=1, J=0, D=0, we need count 1 way (do nothing). Our earlier sum gave 1+2+1=4, which matched. If we used 2 for D=J, we'd get 5. So need special handling for J=0.\n\nSimilarly for J=0, D=1 corresponds to a single down, which is D=J+1 case, count 1 (matches). So modify: if J==0: ways = 1 if D==0 else 1 if D==1 else 0.\n\nGeneral rule for J>=1: as above.\n\nThus implement function count_ways(k) returning integer.\n\nComplexities O(log k). Use Python integers.\n\nTest: k=0: loop J:\nJ=0: D=1-0=1 => D=J+1 => ways=1\nJ=1: D=2-0=2 => D=J+1 => ways=1\nJ=2: D=4-0=4 > J+1=3 => break? continue but D>J+1 so skip. So total 2.\n\nk=1:\nJ=0: D=0 => ways=1\nJ=1: D=1 => D=J => ways=2\nJ=2: D=3 => D=J+1 => ways=1\nTotal 4.\n\nCheck k=2:\nCompute manually maybe.\nJ=0: D= -? D=1-2=-1 skip.\nJ=1: D=2-2=0 => D=J-1? J-1=0 => ways=1\nJ=2: D=4-2=2 => D=J? J=2 => ways=2\nJ=3: D=8-2=6 > J+1=4 skip.\nTotal 3. Let's maybe test by brute small program later.\n\nEdge Cases: large k up to 1e9, loop up to J=31 maybe 32.\n\nReturn result as int.\n\nImplement solve(): read integer k from stdin, print result.\n\nProvide only function body? The prompt: \"Generate an executable Python function generated from the given prompt. Return the function body without invoking it at the final solution.\" So they want a function definition only, not full script? Provide function body only. Probably they expect something like:\n\ndef count_ways(k):\n    ...\n\nBut they said \"Return the function body without invoking it at the final solution.\" Might mean provide the whole function code block.

She can perform operations repeatedly. If she is at step i, she can:\n\n- Move down to step i-1. This operation cannot be used consecutively (i.e., cannot do two down moves in a row) and cannot be used when at step 0 (since can't go below 0).\n\n- Move up to step i + 2^{jump}. After this move, jump becomes jump + 1.\n\nGoal: count total number of ways Alice can reach step k. She may reach step k multiple times (i.e., sequences that visit k multiple times count as distinct ways? The phrase: \"Alice may reach step k and perform some operations to reach step k again.\" So sequences that end at k after any number of steps, possibly having visited k earlier, are counted.\n\nEssentially count number of sequences of moves starting from (position=1, jump=0) that end at position=k at any time (the final state is at k, any jump value). The sequence can be arbitrarily long, but we need to count all possible sequences? That seems infinite unless constraints limit. However maybe due to constraints of moves, there are only finite ways to reach a given k because jumps increase each time you go up, making steps larger, and you cannot go down consecutively, limiting loops. Might still be infinite? Let's test small k: given examples: k=0 output 2. They list 2 ways? Actually they list maybe 2 distinct sequences?

Up moves increase jump each time, making upward steps larger each time, so you cannot return to same position after many cycles because up steps get larger. However you could go up a large step then down 1, then up larger, etc. Could you loop infinitely without exceeding k? Since up steps increase exponentially (2^{jump}), they quickly become huge, so you cannot stay bounded. So number of sequences that end at k is finite.\n\nWe can think of generating all sequences where the up steps are of sizes 1,2,4,8,... (powers of two) in order, each used at most once (since jump increments). So the sequence of up moves is a prefix of powers of two: you may use up moves of sizes 2^0,2^1,... up to some max J-1, each at most once, in order. Between up moves you may insert optional down moves (size 1) but not two consecutive downs.\n\nThus a path is defined by a sequence of actions: for each jump index j from 0 upward, you may decide to do an up move of size 2^j at some point (must be in order). Between up moves you may optionally do a down move (but not two). Also you could start with a down move from step 1 to 0 (since start at 1). That's allowed as first move (since previous not down). After that you cannot do another down immediately.\n\nGoal: final position = k.\n\nWe can model as: start pos=1, jump=0, last_was_down=False. At each step, you can either up (size 2^{jump}) -> pos+=size, jump+=1, last_was_down=False; or down (if pos>0 and not last_was_down) -> pos-=1, last_was_down=True.\n\nWe need count of sequences ending at pos=k (any jump, any last_was_down flag). Since jumps only increase, max jump is limited because pos cannot exceed some bound? Actually you could go arbitrarily high then down many times (but only one down per up). Since each up adds huge amount, you cannot later come back down to small k after many ups because you can only subtract 1 per down, and you cannot have consecutive downs, so after each up you can at most subtract 1 before next up. So net increase after each up-down pair is (2^j -1). So after many steps, position grows roughly sum of (2^j -1) = (2^{J} -1) - J. So grows exponentially. So to reach a given k, you cannot have too many up moves. So finite.\n\nThus we can DP over jump index and position up to k maybe plus some overshoot? But up moves can overshoot beyond k then later down steps may bring back down to k. Since each up adds at least 1, overshoot may be limited because you can only subtract 1 per subsequent up. So overshoot cannot exceed number of remaining up moves. So we can bound position to <= k + max_remaining_ups. Since max remaining ups is limited.\n\nSimpler: we can treat this as counting sequences of length up to J where J is such that sum_{j=0}^{J-1} 2^j = 2^J -1 >= k+something. Since after J up moves, position minimal (if you do a down after each up) is start 1 + sum (2^j -1) = 1 + (2^J -1) - J = 2^J - J. That's still >= k for J large. So we can bound J up to about log2(k+J). So J <= ~log2(k)+2.\n\nThus we can DP over (j, pos, last_down) where j is current jump index (next up size = 2^j). Starting state (j=0, pos=1, last_down=False). Transitions: up -> (j+1, pos+2^j, False). down -> if pos>0 and not last_down -> (j, pos-1, True). Count ways to reach pos=k at any state (any j, any last_down). Since state space small (j up to ~log2(k)+something, pos up to maybe k+J). That's manageable for k up to 1e9? log2(1e9) ~30. pos up to maybe k+30 ~ 1e9+30 which is too large for DP array. Need smarter combinatorial formula.\n\nWe need to count number of sequences leading to k. Observing that down moves only subtract 1 and cannot be consecutive, they essentially can be placed in gaps between up moves, at most one per gap, and possibly before first up (since start at pos=1). Also you could end with a down after last up? Yes, you can end with down as long as not consecutive.\n\nThus each up move corresponds to a \"slot\" where you may optionally insert a down before it (except you cannot have two downs in a row, but since up resets, you can have at most one down between ups). Also you may have a down after the last up (i.e., final move could be down). Also you could start with a down before any up (since start pos=1). So essentially sequence is: optional initial down, then for each up j=0..J-1: up, optionally a down after it (except maybe after last up you could also have down). Wait ordering: you can down before up only if previous move not down. Starting state last not down, so you can down first. After a down, you must up next (since cannot down again). So pattern is alternating down and up, starting possibly with down or up, but never two downs.\n\nThus the sequence is an alternating sequence of moves, where up moves are in increasing power order, and down moves are interleaved at most one between ups, and possibly after the last up.\n\nThus we can represent a sequence by a binary string of length L where 1=up,0=down, with constraint no two 0s, and the up positions correspond to successive powers.\n\nLet J be number of up moves performed. Then there are J up moves, and there can be at most J+1 down moves (including possibly before first up and after last up). But due to no consecutive downs, the number of down moves D can be either J (if start with up and end with up) or J+1 (if start with down and end with down) or J (if start with up and end with down) etc. Actually pattern must alternate, so sequence length = J + D, and they alternate, so |J - D| <=1. Also cannot start with down? It can. So D can be J or J+1 or J-1? If start with up and end with up, D = J-1 (since between ups there are J-1 gaps). If start with up and end with down, D = J (extra down after last up). If start with down and end with up, D = J (down before first up). If start with down and end with down, D = J+1.\n\nThus D can be J-1, J, or J+1, but D >=0.\n\nNow compute final position: start at 1. Each up adds 2^{j} (j from 0 to J-1). Each down subtracts 1. So final position = 1 + sum_{j=0}^{J-1} 2^{j} - D = 1 + (2^{J} -1) - D = 2^{J} - D.\n\nThus we need 2^{J} - D = k => D = 2^{J} - k.\n\nSince D must be non-negative integer and satisfy constraints relative to J: D ∈ {J-1, J, J+1} (and also D >=0). Also D cannot exceed J+1.\n\nThus we need to count number of J such that D = 2^{J} - k is in {J-1, J, J+1} and D >=0.\n\nFor each such J, we need to count number of sequences (alternating patterns) that have exactly J up moves and D down moves, respecting alternation constraints.\n\nGiven J up moves and D down moves, with no two downs consecutive, the number of alternating sequences is determined by whether it starts with up or down.\n\nIf D = J-1: must start and end with up, pattern: up, (down, up) repeated J-1 times. Only 1 sequence.\n\nIf D = J: two possibilities: start with up, end with down; or start with down, end with up. Both are valid alternating sequences. So 2 sequences.\n\nIf D = J+1: must start and end with down, pattern: down, up, down, up,... ending with down. Only 1 sequence.\n\nThus number of sequences for given (J,D) is:\n- 1 if D = J-1 or D = J+1\n- 2 if D = J\n\nEdge cases: J=0? No up moves. Then sum up =0, final position = 1 - D = k => D = 1 - k. But D must be non-negative and <=1? Since with zero up moves, you cannot have any down because you start at step 1, you could do a down to 0 (one down). But you cannot have two downs consecutively, but with zero up moves you cannot have any up to separate. So max D =1. So D can be 0 (no moves) or 1 (single down). Let's see formula: D = 2^{0} - k = 1 - k. So k can be 0 or 1. For k=0, D=1 => D=J+1 (since J=0) => 1 sequence (down). But example says k=0 output 2. Wait they counted 2 ways. Let's examine: Starting at step 1, to reach 0 you can either: down (single down) OR up 2^0=1 to step 2 then down to 1 then down? Actually they described 2 ways: maybe they consider sequences that may include up then down etc. Let's compute using our model: J could be 1? If J=1, then D = 2^1 - k = 2 - 0 =2. D must be in {J-1=0, J=1, J+1=2}. D=2 matches J+1, so valid. Number of sequences for D=J+1 is 1. So total ways = for J=0 (1 way) + J=1 (1 way) =2. That matches example.\n\nSimilarly for k=1: compute possibilities.\nJ=0: D = 1 -1 =0 => D=J => sequences=2? Wait for J=0, D=0, D=J => sequences count? Our earlier rule for J=0 maybe special. With J=0, D=0 means no moves, start at 1, already at k=1, that's a valid way (do nothing). That's 1 way. But also maybe start with up then down? Let's compute J=1: D = 2 -1 =1 => D=J => sequences=2. J=2: D =4 -1 =3, J=2 => D=J+1? J+1=3, yes D=J+1 => sequences=1. Total ways = 1+2+1=4 matches example. Good.\n\nThus formula works.\n\nSo algorithm: iterate J from 0 up to while 2^J - (J+1) <= k? Actually D = 2^J - k must be >=0 and <= J+1. So condition: 0 <= 2^J - k <= J+1 => k <= 2^J <= k + J+1.\n\nThus J such that 2^J is in [k, k+J+1].\n\nSince 2^J grows fast, J up to about log2(k)+1. For k up to 1e9, J up to 31 maybe 32.\n\nWe can loop J from 0 to 60 (since 2^60 > 1e18). For each J compute D = 2^J - k. If D<0 continue. If D > J+1 continue. Then count ways: if D == J: add 2; else (D == J-1 or D == J+1) add 1. Edge case J=0: need to ensure counts correct: For J=0, possible D values: 0 or 1. D=0 => D=J => we earlier said sequences=2? But from earlier reasoning, with J=0, D=0 corresponds to empty sequence (do nothing). That's 1 way, not 2. Our generic rule gives 2, which would be wrong. Let's test: For k=1, J=0, D=0, we need count 1 way (do nothing). Our earlier sum gave 1+2+1=4, which matched. If we used 2 for D=J, we'd get 5. So need special handling for J=0.\n\nSimilarly for J=0, D=1 corresponds to a single down, which is D=J+1 case, count 1 (matches). So modify: if J==0: ways = 1 if D==0 else 1 if D==1 else 0.\n\nGeneral rule for J>=1: as above.\n\nThus implement function count_ways(k) returning integer.\n\nComplexities O(log k). Use Python integers.\n\nTest: k=0: loop J:\nJ=0: D=1-0=1 => D=J+1 => ways=1\nJ=1: D=2-0=2 => D=J+1 => ways=1\nJ=2: D=4-0=4 > J+1=3 => break? continue but D>J+1 so skip. So total 2.\n\nk=1:\nJ=0: D=0 => ways=1\nJ=1: D=1 => D=J => ways=2\nJ=2: D=3 => D=J+1 => ways=1\nTotal 4.\n\nCheck k=2:\nCompute manually maybe.\nJ=0: D= -? D=1-2=-1 skip.\nJ=1: D=2-2=0 => D=J-1? J-1=0 => ways=1\nJ=2: D=4-2=2 => D=J? J=2 => ways=2\nJ=3: D=8-2=6 > J+1=4 skip.\nTotal 3. Let's maybe test by brute small program later.\n\nEdge Cases: large k up to 1e9, loop up to J=31 maybe 32.\n\nReturn result as int.\n\nImplement solve(): read integer k from stdin, print result.\n\nProvide only function body? The prompt: \"Generate an executable Python function generated from the given prompt. Return the function body without invoking it at the final solution.\" So they want a function definition only, not full script? Provide function body only. Probably they expect something like:\n\ndef count_ways(k):\n    ...\n\nBut they said \"Return the function body without invoking it at the final solution.\" Might mean provide the whole function code block. We'll output a code block with the function definition.\n\nThus final answer: code block with function count_ways(k) that returns number.\n\nLet's craft.\n\n", "signature": null, "redacted": false}, {"internal": null, "type": "text", "text": "```python\ndef count_ways(k: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the number of distinct sequences of moves that start at step 1 with jump=0\n    and end at step k, where the allowed moves are:\n      * up by 2**jump (then jump += 1)\n      * down by 1 (cannot be used twice in a row and not allowed at step 0)\n    The result fits in Python's arbitrary‑precision integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < 0:\n        return 0\n\n    total = 0\n    # iterate over possible numbers of up‑moves J\n    # 2**J grows quickly, J up to about 60 is safe for any 64‑bit k\n    for J in range(0, 61):\n        power = 1 << J               # 2**J\n        D = power - k                # required number of down moves\n        if D < 0:\n            continue                 # not enough upward distance\n        if D > J + 1:\n            continue                 # would need more down moves than allowed\n        # count the alternating sequences for this (J, D)\n        if J == 0:\n            # only two possible patterns: no move (D=0) or a single down (D=1)\n            if D == 0 or D == 1:\n                total += 1\n        else:\n            if D == J:\n                total += 2          # can start with up or with down\n            elif D == J - 1 or D == J + 1:\n                total += 1          # forced start/end pattern\n            # other D values are impossible by construction\n    return total\n```", "refusal": null}], "source": "generate", "metadata": null, "internal": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "model": "gpt-oss-120b"}], "metadata": {"task_id": "3414", "question_title": "ค้นหาจำนวนวิธีในการไปถึงบันไดที่ k", "test_cases": [{"input": "0", "output": "2", "testtype": "functional"}, {"input": "1", "output": "4", "testtype": "functional"}], "public_test_cases": [{"input": "0", "output": "2", "testtype": "functional"}, {"input": "1", "output": "4", "testtype": "functional"}], "private_test_cases": [], "difficulty": "hard", "starter_code": "class Solution:\n    def waysToReachStair(self, k: int) -> int:\n        ", "requires_stdin": false}}

Since only increments allowed. Cost to increase element by d is: we can use combination of single and double increments. Since double increments affect two elements simultaneously, it's like we can pair increments across elements.\n\nGoal: minimize total cost to achieve all elements equal to T.\n\nLet total increments needed = sum_i (T - nums[i]) = S. We need to allocate these increments into operations: each operation of type2 increments two elements (i.e., contributes 2 to S) costing cost2. Type1 contributes 1 to S costing cost1.\n\nWe can use any number of type2 operations, each consumes 2 increments from possibly different elements. Since we cannot increment same index twice in same operation (must be distinct i,j). But across operations we can increment same element multiple times.\n\nThus the problem reduces to: given we need to allocate S increments across elements, we can pair increments arbitrarily (as long as each pair involves two distinct indices). Since we have at least two elements (n>=1). If n=1, we cannot use type2 because need distinct i,j, so only type1.\n\nIf n>=2, we can pair increments arbitrarily, but there is a constraint: each element's increments count must be integer. Pairing is just grouping increments into pairs across possibly same element multiple times but each pair uses two different elements. This is equivalent to: we can use up to floor(S/2) type2 operations, but we must ensure that no element gets paired with itself. However, as long as there are at least two elements with remaining increments, we can pair them. The only problematic case is when one element needs many increments while others are already satisfied; you cannot pair its remaining increments with itself, you would need other elements to also have pending increments. So the maximum number of type2 operations is limited by the sum of increments of all elements except the one with largest needed increments? Actually it's like we have multiset of required increments per element: di = T - nums[i]. We can pair increments from two different elements. The maximum number of pairs is floor((S - max_di)/1?) Let's think: each pair consumes 1 increment from two distinct elements, so each element can contribute at most di increments to pairs. The total number of pairs is limited by sum of di over all elements divided by 2, but also limited by sum of di of all elements except the largest, because the largest element cannot pair its increments with itself, so each of its increments must be paired with an increment from another element. So number of pairs <= total increments of other elements = S - max_di. So max pairs = min( floor(S/2), S - max_di ). Since S - max_di <= floor(S/2) when max_di >= ceil(S/2). So overall max pairs = min(floor(S/2), S - max_di). That's the maximum number of type2 ops we can use.\n\nWe want to choose number of type2 ops k (0 <= k <= max_pairs) to minimize cost: total cost = k*cost2 + (S - 2k)*cost1.\n\nIf cost2 < 2*cost1, using type2 is cheaper per increment (cost per increment = cost2/2). So we want as many type2 as possible, i.e., k = max_pairs. If cost2 >= 2*cost1, then type1 is cheaper or equal, so we use k=0.\n\nThus minimal cost for given T is:\n\nif n == 1: cost = (T - nums[0]) * cost1.\n\nelse:\n    S = sum(T - nums[i])\n    max_di = max(T - nums[i])\n    max_pairs = min(S // 2, S - max_di)\n    if cost2 < 2*cost1:\n        k = max_pairs\n    else:\n        k = 0\n    cost = k*cost2 + (S - 2*k)*cost1\n\nNow we need to choose T >= max(nums) to minimize cost. Since cost function is piecewise linear in T (S increases linearly with T, max_di also linear). We can try to evaluate at candidate T values: maybe the optimal T is either max(nums) or max(nums)+something up to maybe max(nums)+something limited by cost ratios.\n\nObservation: If cost2 >= 2*cost1, we never use type2, so cost = (T - nums[i]) * cost1 summed = (n*T - sum(nums)) * cost1. This is increasing with T, so minimal at T = max(nums). So answer = (max(nums)*n - sum(nums)) * cost1.\n\nIf cost2 < 2*cost1, we want to use as many pairs as possible, which depends on max_di. As T increases, S and max_di increase equally (since max_di = T - min(nums?) Actually max_di corresponds to element with smallest original value? Wait max_di = max_i (T - nums[i]) = T - min(nums). So max_di = T - min_val. S = n*T - sum(nums). So S - max_di = n*T - sum - (T - min) = (n-1)*T - (sum - min). So max_pairs = min( floor(S/2), S - max_di ) = min( floor((n*T - sum)/2), (n-1)*T - (sum - min) ).\n\nWe need to compute cost = k*cost2 + (S - 2k)*cost1 with k = max_pairs.\n\nWe can try to find T that minimizes this. Since n up to 1e5, nums up to 1e6, we could binary search over T? The cost function is convex? Likely piecewise linear with slope changes when floor changes. Could brute force over possible T up to maybe max(nums)+something like cost1/cost2? Not safe.\n\nWe can derive formula. Let’s denote A = sum(nums), m = min(nums), M = max(nums). Let T >= M.\n\nCompute S = n*T - A.\nCompute max_di = T - m.\nCompute max_pairs = min( floor(S/2), S - max_di ) = min( floor(S/2), (n-1)*T - (A - m) ).\n\nLet P1 = floor(S/2). Let P2 = (n-1)*T - (A - m). Since S and max_di are integers, P2 integer.\n\nWe need to compare P1 and P2.\n\nCase 1: P1 <= P2 => max_pairs = floor(S/2). Then k = floor(S/2). Cost = floor(S/2)*cost2 + (S - 2*floor(S/2))*cost1. Since S - 2*floor(S/2) is 0 if S even, 1 if odd. So cost = (S//2)*cost2 + (S%2)*cost1.\n\nCase 2: P2 < P1 => max_pairs = P2. Then k = P2. Cost = P2*cost2 + (S - 2*P2)*cost1.\n\nWe need to find T where transition occurs: when floor(S/2) > P2.\n\nCompute inequality: floor(S/2) > P2.\n\nSince S = nT - A. Let’s ignore floor for moment: (nT - A)/2 > P2 = (n-1)T - (A - m). Multiply 2: nT - A > 2(n-1)T - 2(A - m) => nT - A > 2nT -2T -2A +2m => bring terms: 0 > (2nT -2T -2A +2m) - (nT - A) = (2nT -2T -2A +2m - nT + A) = (nT -2T -A +2m) = T*(n-2) - (A - 2m).\n\nThus inequality becomes: T*(n-2) - (A - 2m) < 0 => T < (A - 2m)/(n-2) for n>2.\n\nIf n=2, then P2 = (1)*T - (A - m) = T - (a1+a2 - min) = T - (max+min - min) = T - max. S = 2T - A. floor(S/2) = floor(T - A/2). Since A = a1+a2. Let's handle n=2 separately.\n\nFor n>2, transition threshold T0 = floor((A - 2m -1)/(n-2))? Actually inequality strict: floor(S/2) > P2. Since floor may affect boundary. But roughly, for T less than that threshold, P2 is larger? Wait we derived condition for floor(S/2) > P2. If T is small, maybe floor(S/2) is small. Let's test with example.\n\nWe can just compute cost for T = M and maybe T = M+1 ... up to some bound where cost starts increasing. Since cost function eventually becomes linear with slope? Let's analyze slopes.\n\nWhen case1 (k = floor(S/2)), cost = (S//2)*cost2 + (S%2)*cost1. Approx cost ≈ (S/2)*cost2 + (S%2)*cost1. Since cost2 < 2*cost1, cost per increment is cost2/2 < cost1, so cost increases with slope cost2/2 per unit T (plus occasional extra cost1 when odd). So cost is increasing with T (since slope positive). So minimal at smallest T where case1 holds.\n\nWhen case2 (k = P2), cost = P2*cost2 + (S - 2P2)*cost1. Substitute P2 = (n-1)T - (A - m). Then S - 2P2 = (nT - A) - 2[(n-1)T - (A - m)] = nT - A - 2nT +2T +2A -2m = (-nT +2T) + (A -2m) = T*(2 - n) + (A - 2m). So cost = ((n-1)T - (A - m))*cost2 + (T*(2 - n) + (A - 2m))*cost1.\n\nSimplify: cost = T*( (n-1)*cost2 + (2 - n)*cost1 ) + [ - (A - m)*cost2 + (A - 2m)*cost1 ].\n\nCoefficient of T: (n-1)*cost2 - (n-2)*cost1. Since (2 - n) = -(n-2). So slope = (n-1)*cost2 - (n-2)*cost1.\n\nWe need to see if slope positive or negative. Since cost2 < 2*cost1, but not necessarily less than cost1. For n large, slope could be positive.\n\nIf slope >0, cost increases with T, minimal at smallest T where case2 holds (i.e., T where P2 < floor(S/2)). If slope <0, cost decreases with T, maybe optimal at larger T until transition to case1 where slope changes to cost2/2.\n\nThus overall minimal T likely near the transition point.\n\nWe can compute candidate T values: T = M (max original), and T = ceil( (A - 2m) / (n-2) ) maybe plus 1. Also maybe T where S is even/odd changes.\n\nWe can just evaluate cost for T = M up to M + 2 (or up to M + something). But worst-case n=1e5, values up to 1e6, cost differences may require larger T.\n\nBut we can compute analytically the optimal T in case2 region: Since cost is linear in T, optimal at boundary of region. Region case2 holds when P2 < floor(S/2). That inequality approximates T < (A - 2m)/(n-2). So region is T <= floor( (A - 2m -1)/(n-2) ). Since T must be >= M. So if M is already >= threshold, region case2 empty, only case1.\n\nIf threshold >= M, then region case2 exists for T in [M, threshold]. Since cost linear, optimal at either M or threshold depending on slope sign. Compute slope = (n-1)*cost2 - (n-2)*cost1.\n\nIf slope < 0, cost decreasing with T, so minimal at largest T in region, i.e., T = threshold (or maybe threshold+1 if still case2). If slope >0, minimal at M.\n\nIf slope ==0, any T same.\n\nThus we can evaluate cost at T = M and at T = T_boundary = floor( (A - 2m) / (n-2) ) (or maybe ceil). Need to ensure T_boundary satisfies case2 (i.e., P2 < floor(S/2)). Might need to test both T_boundary and T_boundary+1.\n\nEdge cases: n=2. Let's handle n=2 separately.\n\nFor n=2, we have two elements a,b. Need to make them equal to T >= max(a,b). Increments needed: d1 = T - a, d2 = T - b. S = d1 + d2. max_di = max(d1,d2). max_pairs = min(floor(S/2), S - max_di) = min(floor(S/2), min(d1,d2)). Since S - max_di = min(d1,d2). So max_pairs = min(floor(S/2), min(d1,d2)). Since min(d1,d2) <= floor(S/2) always (because if one is zero, floor(S/2) may be >0). So max_pairs = min(d_small, floor(S/2)). But floor(S/2) >= d_small? Let's see: suppose d1 >= d2. Then S = d1 + d2, floor(S/2) >= d2? If d1 >= d2, worst case d1 huge, d2 small, S/2 approx d1/2 + d2/2 >= d2/2, not necessarily >= d2. Example d1=5,d2=1 => S=6 floor=3, d2=1, so floor>=d2. So max_pairs = d2. So we can pair each increment of the smaller element with one increment of larger element, using d2 type2 ops, leaving remaining increments on larger element (d1 - d2) to be done singly. So cost = d2*cost2 + (d1 - d2)*cost1.\n\nIf cost2 < 2*cost1, we use as many pairs as possible (d2). If cost2 >= 2*cost1, we use 0 pairs, cost = (d1 + d2)*cost1.\n\nThus for n=2, optimal T is just max(a,b) because increasing T adds extra increments to both, which would increase cost (since both need increments). Let's verify: If we increase T by 1, d1 and d2 each increase by 1, so d2 (the smaller) may become larger, but cost increase per T is: we add 2 increments, can pair them (if both need) costing cost2, or singly costing 2*cost1. Since cost2 < 2*cost1, the marginal cost per T is min(cost2, 2*cost1). That's positive, so minimal at T = max. So answer for n=2: let a,b sorted, d_small = max - min, d_large = 0. Actually at T = max, one element needs 0 increments, other needs diff. So cost = diff*cost1 (since no pairing possible). That's minimal.\n\nThus for n=2, answer = (max - min) * cost1.\n\nNow for n>=3, we can apply above analysis.\n\nImplementation steps:\n\n- Compute n, sumA, min_val, max_val.\n- If n == 1: return 0 (already equal)?? Actually need to make all equal, they already equal, cost 0. But T can be any >= nums[0]; minimal is 0.\n- If n == 2: return (max_val - min_val) * cost1 % MOD.\n- Else n >=3:\n    - If cost2 >= 2*cost1: answer = (max_val * n - sumA) * cost1 % MOD.\n    - Else:\n        - Compute threshold = (sumA - 2*min_val) // (n - 2)  # floor division\n        - Ensure threshold >= max_val? If threshold < max_val, region case2 empty, answer = cost at T = max_val using case1 formula.\n        - Evaluate cost at T1 = max_val.\n        - Evaluate cost at T2 = threshold (if threshold >= max_val). Also maybe T2+1 because floor/ceil boundary.\n        - For each candidate T, compute cost using general formula:\n            S = n*T - sumA\n            max_di = T - min_val\n            max_pairs = min(S//2, S - max_di)\n            if cost2 < 2*cost1: k = max_pairs else k=0\n            cost = k*cost2 + (S - 2*k)*cost1\n        - Take min modulo MOD.\n\nEdge: threshold may be large, but evaluating few candidates is fine.\n\nTest with examples.\n\nExample1: nums=[4,1], n=2 => answer = (4-1)*5=15 correct.\n\nExample2: nums=[2,3,3,3,5], n=5, sum=16, min=2, max=5, cost1=2, cost2=1 (<2*cost1). Compute threshold = (16 - 4) // (5-2)=12//3=4. threshold=4 >= max=5? No, threshold < max, so region case2 empty. So evaluate at T=5.\n\nCompute S =5*5-16=9, max_di=5-2=3, max_pairs = min(9//2=4, 9-3=6) =>4. k=4 (since cost2 cheaper). cost =4*1 + (9-8)*2=4+2=6 matches.\n\nExample3: nums=[3,5,3], n=3, sum=11, min=3, max=5, cost1=1, cost2=3. cost2=3 >=2*1=2, so use only cost1. answer = (5*3-11)*1 = (15-11)=4 correct.\n\nEdge test where cost2 cheap and threshold >= max.\n\nLet's craft: nums=[1,1,10], n=3, sum=12, min=1, max=10, cost1=10, cost2=1 (very cheap). threshold = (12 -2) // (1) =10 //1=10. threshold=10 >= max=10. Evaluate T=10 and T=10 (same). Compute S = 3*10-12=18, max_di=10-1=9, max_pairs = min(9, 18-9=9) =9. k=9, cost =9*1 + (18-18)*10=9. Could we do better with higher T? Let's test T=11: S=33-12=21, max_di=10, max_pairs = min(10,21-10=11)=10, cost=10*1 + (21-20)*10=10+10=20 >9. So minimal at T=10. Good.\n\nNow case where slope negative, maybe optimal at threshold > max. Example: n=5, cost1=10, cost2=15 (cost2<2*cost1? 15<20 yes). slope = (n-1)*cost2 - (n-2)*cost1 =4*15 -3*10=60-30=30 positive, so cost increasing with T in case2, so minimal at M. So our candidate set includes M.\n\nIf slope negative: need cost2 relatively small compared to cost1 and n large? slope negative when (n-1)*cost2 < (n-2)*cost1 => cost2/cost1 < (n-2)/(n-1). For large n, RHS ~1. So if cost2 < cost1, slope negative. Example n=5, cost1=10, cost2=5. slope =4*5 -3*10 =20-30=-10 negative. threshold maybe > max. Let's test: nums=[1,2,3,4,5], sum=15, min=1, max=5, n=5, cost1=10, cost2=5. threshold = (15 -2) //3 =13//3=4. threshold=4 < max=5, region empty, so only case1. So not relevant.\n\nNeed case where threshold >= max. Let's try nums with small min relative to sum. Example: nums=[1,1,1,100], n=4, sum=103, min=1, max=100, cost1=10, cost2=5. threshold = (103 -2) //2 =101//2=50 < max. So region empty.\n\nMaybe region only when min is not too small? Actually threshold = (sum - 2*min)/(n-2). For threshold >= max, need (sum - 2*min) >= (n-2)*max. Since sum = min + other values.

Since only increments allowed. Cost to increase element by d is: we can use combination of single and double increments. Since double increments affect two elements simultaneously, it's like we can pair increments across elements.\n\nGoal: minimize total cost to achieve all elements equal to T.\n\nLet total increments needed = sum_i (T - nums[i]) = S. We need to allocate these increments into operations: each operation of type2 increments two elements (i.e., contributes 2 to S) costing cost2. Type1 contributes 1 to S costing cost1.\n\nWe can use any number of type2 operations, each consumes 2 increments from possibly different elements. Since we cannot increment same index twice in same operation (must be distinct i,j). But across operations we can increment same element multiple times.\n\nThus the problem reduces to: given we need to allocate S increments across elements, we can pair increments arbitrarily (as long as each pair involves two distinct indices). Since we have at least two elements (n>=1). If n=1, we cannot use type2 because need distinct i,j, so only type1.\n\nIf n>=2, we can pair increments arbitrarily, but there is a constraint: each element's increments count must be integer. Pairing is just grouping increments into pairs across possibly same element multiple times but each pair uses two different elements. This is equivalent to: we can use up to floor(S/2) type2 operations, but we must ensure that no element gets paired with itself. However, as long as there are at least two elements with remaining increments, we can pair them. The only problematic case is when one element needs many increments while others are already satisfied; you cannot pair its remaining increments with itself, you would need other elements to also have pending increments. So the maximum number of type2 operations is limited by the sum of increments of all elements except the one with largest needed increments? Actually it's like we have multiset of required increments per element: di = T - nums[i]. We can pair increments from two different elements. The maximum number of pairs is floor((S - max_di)/1?) Let's think: each pair consumes 1 increment from two distinct elements, so each element can contribute at most di increments to pairs. The total number of pairs is limited by sum of di over all elements divided by 2, but also limited by sum of di of all elements except the largest, because the largest element cannot pair its increments with itself, so each of its increments must be paired with an increment from another element. So number of pairs <= total increments of other elements = S - max_di. So max pairs = min( floor(S/2), S - max_di ). Since S - max_di <= floor(S/2) when max_di >= ceil(S/2). So overall max pairs = min(floor(S/2), S - max_di). That's the maximum number of type2 ops we can use.\n\nWe want to choose number of type2 ops k (0 <= k <= max_pairs) to minimize cost: total cost = k*cost2 + (S - 2k)*cost1.\n\nIf cost2 < 2*cost1, using type2 is cheaper per increment (cost per increment = cost2/2). So we want as many type2 as possible, i.e., k = max_pairs. If cost2 >= 2*cost1, then type1 is cheaper or equal, so we use k=0.\n\nThus minimal cost for given T is:\n\nif n == 1: cost = (T - nums[0]) * cost1.\n\nelse:\n    S = sum(T - nums[i])\n    max_di = max(T - nums[i])\n    max_pairs = min(S // 2, S - max_di)\n    if cost2 < 2*cost1:\n        k = max_pairs\n    else:\n        k = 0\n    cost = k*cost2 + (S - 2*k)*cost1\n\nNow we need to choose T >= max(nums) to minimize cost. Since cost function is piecewise linear in T (S increases linearly with T, max_di also linear). We can try to evaluate at candidate T values: maybe the optimal T is either max(nums) or max(nums)+something up to maybe max(nums)+something limited by cost ratios.\n\nObservation: If cost2 >= 2*cost1, we never use type2, so cost = (T - nums[i]) * cost1 summed = (n*T - sum(nums)) * cost1. This is increasing with T, so minimal at T = max(nums). So answer = (max(nums)*n - sum(nums)) * cost1.\n\nIf cost2 < 2*cost1, we want to use as many pairs as possible, which depends on max_di. As T increases, S and max_di increase equally (since max_di = T - min(nums?) Actually max_di corresponds to element with smallest original value? Wait max_di = max_i (T - nums[i]) = T - min(nums). So max_di = T - min_val. S = n*T - sum(nums). So S - max_di = n*T - sum - (T - min) = (n-1)*T - (sum - min). So max_pairs = min( floor(S/2), S - max_di ) = min( floor((n*T - sum)/2), (n-1)*T - (sum - min) ).\n\nWe need to compute cost = k*cost2 + (S - 2k)*cost1 with k = max_pairs.\n\nWe can try to find T that minimizes this. Since n up to 1e5, nums up to 1e6, we could binary search over T? The cost function is convex? Likely piecewise linear with slope changes when floor changes. Could brute force over possible T up to maybe max(nums)+something like cost1/cost2? Not safe.\n\nWe can derive formula. Let’s denote A = sum(nums), m = min(nums), M = max(nums). Let T >= M.\n\nCompute S = n*T - A.\nCompute max_di = T - m.\nCompute max_pairs = min( floor(S/2), S - max_di ) = min( floor(S/2), (n-1)*T - (A - m) ).\n\nLet P1 = floor(S/2). Let P2 = (n-1)*T - (A - m). Since S and max_di are integers, P2 integer.\n\nWe need to compare P1 and P2.\n\nCase 1: P1 <= P2 => max_pairs = floor(S/2). Then k = floor(S/2). Cost = floor(S/2)*cost2 + (S - 2*floor(S/2))*cost1. Since S - 2*floor(S/2) is 0 if S even, 1 if odd. So cost = (S//2)*cost2 + (S%2)*cost1.\n\nCase 2: P2 < P1 => max_pairs = P2. Then k = P2. Cost = P2*cost2 + (S - 2*P2)*cost1.\n\nWe need to find T where transition occurs: when floor(S/2) > P2.\n\nCompute inequality: floor(S/2) > P2.\n\nSince S = nT - A. Let’s ignore floor for moment: (nT - A)/2 > P2 = (n-1)T - (A - m). Multiply 2: nT - A > 2(n-1)T - 2(A - m) => nT - A > 2nT -2T -2A +2m => bring terms: 0 > (2nT -2T -2A +2m) - (nT - A) = (2nT -2T -2A +2m - nT + A) = (nT -2T -A +2m) = T*(n-2) - (A - 2m).\n\nThus inequality becomes: T*(n-2) - (A - 2m) < 0 => T < (A - 2m)/(n-2) for n>2.\n\nIf n=2, then P2 = (1)*T - (A - m) = T - (a1+a2 - min) = T - (max+min - min) = T - max. S = 2T - A. floor(S/2) = floor(T - A/2). Since A = a1+a2. Let's handle n=2 separately.\n\nFor n>2, transition threshold T0 = floor((A - 2m -1)/(n-2))? Actually inequality strict: floor(S/2) > P2. Since floor may affect boundary. But roughly, for T less than that threshold, P2 is larger? Wait we derived condition for floor(S/2) > P2. If T is small, maybe floor(S/2) is small. Let's test with example.\n\nWe can just compute cost for T = M and maybe T = M+1 ... up to some bound where cost starts increasing. Since cost function eventually becomes linear with slope? Let's analyze slopes.\n\nWhen case1 (k = floor(S/2)), cost = (S//2)*cost2 + (S%2)*cost1. Approx cost ≈ (S/2)*cost2 + (S%2)*cost1. Since cost2 < 2*cost1, cost per increment is cost2/2 < cost1, so cost increases with slope cost2/2 per unit T (plus occasional extra cost1 when odd). So cost is increasing with T (since slope positive). So minimal at smallest T where case1 holds.\n\nWhen case2 (k = P2), cost = P2*cost2 + (S - 2P2)*cost1. Substitute P2 = (n-1)T - (A - m). Then S - 2P2 = (nT - A) - 2[(n-1)T - (A - m)] = nT - A - 2nT +2T +2A -2m = (-nT +2T) + (A -2m) = T*(2 - n) + (A - 2m). So cost = ((n-1)T - (A - m))*cost2 + (T*(2 - n) + (A - 2m))*cost1.\n\nSimplify: cost = T*( (n-1)*cost2 + (2 - n)*cost1 ) + [ - (A - m)*cost2 + (A - 2m)*cost1 ].\n\nCoefficient of T: (n-1)*cost2 - (n-2)*cost1. Since (2 - n) = -(n-2). So slope = (n-1)*cost2 - (n-2)*cost1.\n\nWe need to see if slope positive or negative. Since cost2 < 2*cost1, but not necessarily less than cost1. For n large, slope could be positive.\n\nIf slope >0, cost increases with T, minimal at smallest T where case2 holds (i.e., T where P2 < floor(S/2)). If slope <0, cost decreases with T, maybe optimal at larger T until transition to case1 where slope changes to cost2/2.\n\nThus overall minimal T likely near the transition point.\n\nWe can compute candidate T values: T = M (max original), and T = ceil( (A - 2m) / (n-2) ) maybe plus 1. Also maybe T where S is even/odd changes.\n\nWe can just evaluate cost for T = M up to M + 2 (or up to M + something). But worst-case n=1e5, values up to 1e6, cost differences may require larger T.\n\nBut we can compute analytically the optimal T in case2 region: Since cost is linear in T, optimal at boundary of region. Region case2 holds when P2 < floor(S/2). That inequality approximates T < (A - 2m)/(n-2). So region is T <= floor( (A - 2m -1)/(n-2) ). Since T must be >= M. So if M is already >= threshold, region case2 empty, only case1.\n\nIf threshold >= M, then region case2 exists for T in [M, threshold]. Since cost linear, optimal at either M or threshold depending on slope sign. Compute slope = (n-1)*cost2 - (n-2)*cost1.\n\nIf slope < 0, cost decreasing with T, so minimal at largest T in region, i.e., T = threshold (or maybe threshold+1 if still case2). If slope >0, minimal at M.\n\nIf slope ==0, any T same.\n\nThus we can evaluate cost at T = M and at T = T_boundary = floor( (A - 2m) / (n-2) ) (or maybe ceil). Need to ensure T_boundary satisfies case2 (i.e., P2 < floor(S/2)). Might need to test both T_boundary and T_boundary+1.\n\nEdge cases: n=2. Let's handle n=2 separately.\n\nFor n=2, we have two elements a,b. Need to make them equal to T >= max(a,b). Increments needed: d1 = T - a, d2 = T - b. S = d1 + d2. max_di = max(d1,d2). max_pairs = min(floor(S/2), S - max_di) = min(floor(S/2), min(d1,d2)). Since S - max_di = min(d1,d2). So max_pairs = min(floor(S/2), min(d1,d2)). Since min(d1,d2) <= floor(S/2) always (because if one is zero, floor(S/2) may be >0). So max_pairs = min(d_small, floor(S/2)). But floor(S/2) >= d_small? Let's see: suppose d1 >= d2. Then S = d1 + d2, floor(S/2) >= d2? If d1 >= d2, worst case d1 huge, d2 small, S/2 approx d1/2 + d2/2 >= d2/2, not necessarily >= d2. Example d1=5,d2=1 => S=6 floor=3, d2=1, so floor>=d2. So max_pairs = d2. So we can pair each increment of the smaller element with one increment of larger element, using d2 type2 ops, leaving remaining increments on larger element (d1 - d2) to be done singly. So cost = d2*cost2 + (d1 - d2)*cost1.\n\nIf cost2 < 2*cost1, we use as many pairs as possible (d2). If cost2 >= 2*cost1, we use 0 pairs, cost = (d1 + d2)*cost1.\n\nThus for n=2, optimal T is just max(a,b) because increasing T adds extra increments to both, which would increase cost (since both need increments). Let's verify: If we increase T by 1, d1 and d2 each increase by 1, so d2 (the smaller) may become larger, but cost increase per T is: we add 2 increments, can pair them (if both need) costing cost2, or singly costing 2*cost1. Since cost2 < 2*cost1, the marginal cost per T is min(cost2, 2*cost1). That's positive, so minimal at T = max. So answer for n=2: let a,b sorted, d_small = max - min, d_large = 0. Actually at T = max, one element needs 0 increments, other needs diff. So cost = diff*cost1 (since no pairing possible). That's minimal.\n\nThus for n=2, answer = (max - min) * cost1.\n\nNow for n>=3, we can apply above analysis.\n\nImplementation steps:\n\n- Compute n, sumA, min_val, max_val.\n- If n == 1: return 0 (already equal)?? Actually need to make all equal, they already equal, cost 0. But T can be any >= nums[0]; minimal is 0.\n- If n == 2: return (max_val - min_val) * cost1 % MOD.\n- Else n >=3:\n    - If cost2 >= 2*cost1: answer = (max_val * n - sumA) * cost1 % MOD.\n    - Else:\n        - Compute threshold = (sumA - 2*min_val) // (n - 2)  # floor division\n        - Ensure threshold >= max_val? If threshold < max_val, region case2 empty, answer = cost at T = max_val using case1 formula.\n        - Evaluate cost at T1 = max_val.\n        - Evaluate cost at T2 = threshold (if threshold >= max_val). Also maybe T2+1 because floor/ceil boundary.\n        - For each candidate T, compute cost using general formula:\n            S = n*T - sumA\n            max_di = T - min_val\n            max_pairs = min(S//2, S - max_di)\n            if cost2 < 2*cost1: k = max_pairs else k=0\n            cost = k*cost2 + (S - 2*k)*cost1\n        - Take min modulo MOD.\n\nEdge: threshold may be large, but evaluating few candidates is fine.\n\nTest with examples.\n\nExample1: nums=[4,1], n=2 => answer = (4-1)*5=15 correct.\n\nExample2: nums=[2,3,3,3,5], n=5, sum=16, min=2, max=5, cost1=2, cost2=1 (<2*cost1). Compute threshold = (16 - 4) // (5-2)=12//3=4. threshold=4 >= max=5? No, threshold < max, so region case2 empty. So evaluate at T=5.\n\nCompute S =5*5-16=9, max_di=5-2=3, max_pairs = min(9//2=4, 9-3=6) =>4. k=4 (since cost2 cheaper). cost =4*1 + (9-8)*2=4+2=6 matches.\n\nExample3: nums=[3,5,3], n=3, sum=11, min=3, max=5, cost1=1, cost2=3. cost2=3 >=2*1=2, so use only cost1. answer = (5*3-11)*1 = (15-11)=4 correct.\n\nEdge test where cost2 cheap and threshold >= max.\n\nLet's craft: nums=[1,1,10], n=3, sum=12, min=1, max=10, cost1=10, cost2=1 (very cheap). threshold = (12 -2) // (1) =10 //1=10. threshold=10 >= max=10. Evaluate T=10 and T=10 (same). Compute S = 3*10-12=18, max_di=10-1=9, max_pairs = min(9, 18-9=9) =9. k=9, cost =9*1 + (18-18)*10=9. Could we do better with higher T? Let's test T=11: S=33-12=21, max_di=10, max_pairs = min(10,21-10=11)=10, cost=10*1 + (21-20)*10=10+10=20 >9. So minimal at T=10. Good.\n\nNow case where slope negative, maybe optimal at threshold > max. Example: n=5, cost1=10, cost2=15 (cost2<2*cost1? 15<20 yes). slope = (n-1)*cost2 - (n-2)*cost1 =4*15 -3*10=60-30=30 positive, so cost increasing with T in case2, so minimal at M. So our candidate set includes M.\n\nIf slope negative: need cost2 relatively small compared to cost1 and n large? slope negative when (n-1)*cost2 < (n-2)*cost1 => cost2/cost1 < (n-2)/(n-1). For large n, RHS ~1. So if cost2 < cost1, slope negative. Example n=5, cost1=10, cost2=5. slope =4*5 -3*10 =20-30=-10 negative. threshold maybe > max. Let's test: nums=[1,2,3,4,5], sum=15, min=1, max=5, n=5, cost1=10, cost2=5. threshold = (15 -2) //3 =13//3=4. threshold=4 < max=5, region empty, so only case1.
