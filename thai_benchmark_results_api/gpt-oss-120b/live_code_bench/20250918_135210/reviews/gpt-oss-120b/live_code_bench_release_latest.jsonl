The algorithm outputs **YES** (`0 ≤ 2`).\n\n*Lemma 2*  \nIf `s` differs from `abc` in exactly `2` positions, swapping those two\npositions makes the strings equal.\n*Proof.*  \nLet the mismatching indices be `i` and `j`.  \nBecause `s` is a permutation of `a,b,c`, the character that should be at\nposition `i` (i.e. `target[i]`) is currently at position `j`, and vice\nversa. Swapping `i` and `j` puts each character to its correct place,\nso the result is `abc`. ∎  \nThe algorithm outputs **YES** (`2 ≤ 2`).\n\n*Lemma 3*  \nIf `s` differs from `abc` in `3` positions, it is a 3‑cycle and cannot\nbe turned into `abc` with a single swap.\n*Proof.*  \nAll three characters are misplaced, so each of them occupies the place\nof another one. Any swap fixes at most two positions, leaving at least\none mismatch, thus the final string cannot be `abc`. ∎  \nThe algorithm outputs **NO** (`3 > 2`).\n\n*Lemma 4*  \n` s` can never differ from `abc` in exactly `1` position, because the\nstring contains each of `a,b,c` exactly once.

Greedy optimality\n\nConsider the leftmost black cell that is still uncovered, let its index be `i`.\n\nAny feasible solution must contain an interval that covers this cell.\nIf the interval starts at position `p ( ≤ i )`, its right end is `p + k - 1`.\nTo cover as many cells to the **right** as possible we should start the\ninterval as far **right** as we can, i.e. at `p = i`.\nThat interval reaches `i + k - 1`, which is the farthest possible right end\namong all intervals covering `i`.\n\nTherefore an optimal solution can always be transformed into one that\n*places an interval starting at the first uncovered black cell*.\nAfter placing it, all cells up to `i + k - 1` become white, and we repeat the\nsame argument for the next uncovered black cell.\n\nConsequently the following greedy algorithm is optimal:\n\n```\nanswer = 0\ni = 0\nwhile i < n:\n        if s[i] == 'B':          # first uncovered black cell\n                answer += 1\n                i += k           # the whole block [i, i+k-1] is now white\n        else:\n                i += 1\n```\n\nThe algorithm scans the string once, each step moves the pointer at least\none position, therefore it works in `O(n)` time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.

By Lemma&nbsp;2 after this operation both the algorithm and an\noptimal solution have no black cells before `i+k`.  \nHence the algorithm’s count (previous optimal count + 1) is exactly the\nminimal number for the new prefix. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nFor each test case the algorithm outputs the minimum possible number of\noperations needed to turn the whole strip white.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWhen the loop finishes, `i = n`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the number stored in `answer` equals the minimal number of\noperations required for the whole prefix `[0, n-1]`, i.e. for the entire\nstrip. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

When can a multiset of characters be rearranged to a palindrome ?\n\nOnly the **parities** of the character frequencies matter.\n\n*If the length is even* – every character must appear an even number of times.  \n*If the length is odd* – exactly one character may appear an odd number of times,\nall others must be even.\n\nSo for a string of length `L`\n\n```\nallowed_odd = L mod 2          # 0 for even, 1 for odd\n```\n\nThe multiset is good **iff** the number of characters whose frequency is odd\n(`odd_cnt`) is `≤ allowed_odd` (actually `== allowed_odd` because we can always\ndelete extra even‑count characters later).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.   Effect of deletions on parities  \n\nFor a character `c`\n\n```\noriginal parity   = cnt[c] mod 2\ndeletions of c    = d[c]          (0 ≤ d[c] ≤ cnt[c])\nnew parity        = (cnt[c] - d[c]) mod 2\n                  = (cnt[c] mod 2) xor (d[c] mod 2)\n```\n\nOnly the **parity of the number of deletions of this character** matters.\nIf we delete an odd number of `c` we *flip* its parity,\notherwise we keep it.\n\nLet  \n\n* `O` – number of characters with odd original frequency  \n* `x` – number of characters for which we delete an **odd** amount  \n  (`x = |{c : d[c] is odd}|`)\n\nFlipping a character that was odd makes it even, flipping an even one makes it\nodd. Therefore the final number of odd characters is\n\n```\nfinal_odd = | O - x |   … (the smallest possible)\n            … up to O + x (the largest possible)\n```\n\nAll values having the same parity as `O + x` are reachable.\nThe exact values are not needed – we only need to know whether we can reach a\nvalue `≤ allowed_odd`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Minimal deletions needed to reach the parity condition  \n\nThe cheapest way to reduce the number of odd characters is:\n\n* delete **one** occurrence from an odd‑frequency character → its parity becomes even\n\nEach such deletion reduces `odd_cnt` by `1` and costs exactly `1` deletion.\nIf we need the final odd count to be `allowed_odd`,\nthe minimal number of deletions that *must* be performed is\n\n```\nneed = max(0, O - allowed_odd)\n```\n\nIf `need > k` we cannot delete enough characters → answer **NO**.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   What about the remaining deletions ?\n\nAfter performing `need` deletions we already have the correct parity\n(`odd_cnt = allowed_odd`).  \nThe remaining deletions are `rem = k - need`.\n\n*Deleting two characters of the same kind* (or any two characters) does **not**\nchange any parity, because each character is deleted an even number of times.\nHence we can always waste deletions in pairs.\n\nThe only possible problem is when `rem` is **odd** and the required final\nodd count is `0` (the remaining length is even).  \nDeleting a single extra character would flip the parity of one character,\nmaking the odd count `1` – not allowed.\n\nTherefore\n\n```\nif allowed_odd == 0 and rem is odd → impossible\nelse                                   possible\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm prints “YES” exactly for the feasible test cases.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nLet `O` be the number of odd‑frequency characters in the original string.\nTo obtain a multiset whose odd count is at most `allowed`,\nat least `max(0, O - allowed)` deletions are necessary.\n\n**Proof.**  \nEach deletion can change the parity of **at most one** character\n(the character we delete from).  \nIf a character is odd we must delete at least one occurrence from it\nto make it even.  \nThus we need to flip at least `O - allowed` odd characters, each requiring\none deletion. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf we delete exactly `need = max(0, O - allowed)` characters,\nit is always possible to reach a multiset with odd count `allowed`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nDelete one occurrence from any `need` distinct characters that are odd\n(in the original string).  \nEach such deletion makes that character even, decreasing the odd count by\n`1`.  \nAfter `need` deletions the odd count becomes `O - need = allowed`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nAfter performing the `need` deletions of Lemma&nbsp;2,\nany further **even** number of deletions can be performed without changing\nthe odd count.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake the even number `2·q`. Delete `q` characters from any character,\nand another `q` characters from (possibly the same) character.\nEach character receives an even number of deletions, therefore its parity\nremains unchanged. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf `allowed = 0` (the final length is even) and the remaining deletions\n`rem = k - need` are odd, then it is impossible to finish with odd count `0`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAfter the `need` deletions the odd count is already `0`.  \nAn additional odd number of deletions flips the parity of exactly one\ncharacter, turning its count odd and raising the odd count to `1`.  \nNo further deletions are left (they would change the length), so the final\nodd count cannot be `0`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nIf `allowed = 1` (final length odd) then any parity of `rem` is feasible.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAfter the `need` deletions we have odd count `1`.  \nIf `rem` is even we can use Lemma&nbsp;3 and keep the odd count `1`.  \nIf `rem` is odd we delete one more character from the (unique) odd‑frequency\ncharacter, making its count even; the odd count becomes `0`, which is still\n`≤ allowed = 1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nFor each test case the algorithm outputs “YES” **iff** there exists a way\nto delete exactly `k` characters so that the remaining characters can be\nreordered into a palindrome.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Soundness* (algorithm says YES ⇒ feasible).  \nThe algorithm checks two conditions:\n\n1. `need ≤ k`. By Lemma&nbsp;2 we can achieve odd count `allowed` using exactly\n   `need` deletions.\n2. If `allowed = 0` it also requires `(k-need)` even. By Lemma&nbsp;3 we can\n   spend the remaining even deletions without changing the odd count,\n   ending with odd count `0`.  \n   If `allowed = 1` no extra restriction is needed; Lemma&nbsp;5 guarantees\n   feasibility for any remaining parity.\n\nThus a concrete deletion scheme exists, so the answer is indeed feasible.\n\n*Completeness* (feasible ⇒ algorithm says YES).  \nAssume a feasible deletion set exists.\n\n* By Lemma&nbsp;1 any feasible solution must delete at least `need` characters,\n  therefore `need ≤ k`. The algorithm’s first test passes.\n* After those `need` deletions the odd count is exactly `allowed`\n  (otherwise the remaining length could not be a palindrome).\n  The rest of the deletions are `rem = k-need`.  \n  If `allowed = 0`, the final odd count must stay `0`, which is only possible\n  when `rem` is even (Lemma&nbsp;4).  \n  If `allowed = 1`, any `rem` works (Lemma&nbsp;5).\n\nHence the algorithm’s second test also passes, and it outputs “YES”.\n\nBoth directions hold, completing the proof. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm outputs the minimum possible number of\noperations.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor each array element the algorithm stores, for every feasible\ntriple `(a2,a3,a5)`, the minimum number of increments needed to obtain\nexactly that triple (or a larger one, which is capped to the needed\nmaximum).\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm enumerates all increment values `d = 0 … 10`.  \nFor each `d` it computes the resulting exponents and therefore the\ntriple `(add2,add3,add5)`.  \nIf the same triple appears for several `d`, the algorithm keeps the\nsmallest `d`.  \nBecause any optimal solution never needs more than `10` increments for a\nsingle element (the worst case needs at most `4`), the minimum over the\nenumerated `d` equals the true minimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nAfter processing the first `t` array elements,\n`dp[i][j][l]` equals the minimum total number of operations that can be\nachieved using **only** those `t` elements and that yields at least\n`i` copies of `2`, `j` copies of `3`, `l` copies of `5`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nInduction over `t`.\n\n*Base (`t = 0`).*  \nOnly the empty set of elements is available.\n`dp[0][0][0]=0` (cost 0, no copies) and all other states are impossible,\nhence INF – the statement holds.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement true after `t‑1` elements.\nWhen the `t`‑th element is processed, for each of its possible triples\n`(a2,a3,a5)` with cost `c` the algorithm tries to add this element to\nevery previously reachable state `(i,j,l)`.  \nThe new state becomes `(min(miss[2], i+a2), …)`.  \nThe transition cost is `dp_old[i][j][l] + c`.  \nBecause the loops run backwards, each old state uses only the first\n`t‑1` elements, therefore the new value corresponds to a solution that\nuses the first `t` elements and includes the `t`‑th element exactly once.\nTaking the minimum over *all* possibilities (including the option of not\nusing the element) yields the optimal cost for the first `t` elements.\nThus the invariant holds for `t`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nWhen all `n` elements have been processed,\n`dp[miss[2]][miss[3]][miss[5]]` equals the minimum number of operations\nthat makes the whole product divisible by `k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the final DP entry is the cheapest way to obtain at least\n`miss[2]` copies of `2`, `miss[3]` copies of `3` and `miss[5]` copies of\n`5` using any subset of the `n` elements.\nAdding these missing copies to the already existing ones makes the total\nexponent of each prime at least the required one, i.e. the product becomes\ndivisible by `k`.  \nConversely, any sequence of operations that achieves divisibility must\ncreate at least those missing copies, therefore its cost is bounded below\nby the DP value. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm never underestimates the answer.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAssume an optimal sequence of operations exists with total cost `C`.\nConsider the final values of the array after those operations.\nFor each element, the number of increments applied to it is some `d`.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the algorithm knows a (possibly smaller) cost `d' ≤ d`\nthat yields *at least* the same increase of prime exponents.\nReplacing each element’s real cost `d` by `d'` can only lower the total\ncost, never increase it.\nConsequently the DP, which is allowed to pick any combination of the\n`d'` costs, can achieve a total cost `≤ C`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nThe algorithm never overestimates the answer.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe DP constructs a concrete set of elements together with concrete\nincrement amounts (the ones stored in the DP transition) whose total\ncost equals the DP value.  \nBy construction these increments give at least the required additional\nprime factors, therefore they indeed make the product divisible by `k`.\nThus the DP value is achievable, i.e. not larger than the optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nFor every test case the algorithm outputs the minimum possible number of\noperations needed to make the product of the array divisible by `k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf the product is already divisible, the algorithm outputs `0`, which is\noptimal.  \nOtherwise, let `OPT` be the true optimum.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm’s answer `ANS` satisfies `ANS ≤ OPT`.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;5 we have `ANS ≥ OPT`.\nTherefore `ANS = OPT`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Hence after the loop finishes  \n\n```\nmin_sum = min_i S(i,k) ,   max_sum = max_i S(i,k)\n```\n\nand `diff = max_sum – min_sum = diff(k)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor every divisor `k` of `n` the algorithm considers `k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll divisors are generated by the standard `i = 1 … √n` loop:\nif `i` divides `n`, both `i` and `n/i` are inserted into the list.\nThus the list contains **exactly** the set `{ k | 1 ≤ k ≤ n , k | n }`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \n`answer` after processing all divisors equals  \n`max_{k|n} diff(k)`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nInitially `answer = 0`.  \nWhen a divisor `k` is processed, by Lemma&nbsp;1 we obtain `diff(k)`.\n`answer` is updated with `max(answer, diff(k))`.  \nConsequently after the last divisor the invariant  \n\n```\nanswer = max_{processed k} diff(k)\n```\n\nholds, and because *all* divisors are processed (Lemma&nbsp;2) the set of\nprocessed `k` is exactly `{ k | k divides n }`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nFor each test case the algorithm outputs the maximum possible absolute\ndifference between the total weights of two trucks over all admissible\ntruck capacities `k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy definition of the problem the wanted value is  \n\n```\nmax_{k|n} ( max_i S(i,k) – min_i S(i,k) ) = max_{k|n} diff(k)\n```\n\nLemma&nbsp;3 shows that the algorithm returns exactly this quantity. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible sum.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor every index `i` the value `dp[i]` computed by the algorithm equals the\nmaximum sum of a valid subarray that ends at `i`.\n\n**Proof.** By induction over `i`.\n\n*Base `i = 0`* : the only subarray ending at `0` is `[a[0]]`, its sum is `a[0]`.\nThe algorithm sets `dp[0] = a[0]`. So the statement holds.\n\n*Induction step.* Assume the statement true for `i‑1`.  \nConsider position `i`.\n\n*Case 1 – different parity with `i‑1`.*  \nAny valid subarray ending at `i` is either  \n\n* just `[a[i]]` (sum `a[i]`), or  \n* a valid subarray ending at `i‑1` (its sum is at most `dp[i‑1]` by the\n  induction hypothesis) followed by `a[i]`.  \n  Its total sum is `a[i] + (sum of that subarray)`.  \n  To maximise it we take the best possible sum for the prefix, i.e. `dp[i‑1]`.\n  If `dp[i‑1]` is negative we are better off not taking it, i.e. add `0`.\n\nHence the optimal sum is `a[i] + max(0, dp[i‑1])`, exactly the algorithm’s\nformula.\n\n*Case 2 – equal parity.*  \nNo valid subarray can contain both `a[i‑1]` and `a[i]`.  \nTherefore any valid subarray ending at `i` must start at `i`, its sum is `a[i]`.\nThe algorithm also sets `dp[i] = a[i]`.\n\nThus in both cases the algorithm computes the optimum, completing the\ninduction. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \n`ans = max_i dp[i]` equals the maximum sum over **all** valid non‑empty subarrays.\n\n**Proof.** Every valid subarray has a last position `r`. Its sum is bounded by\n`dp[r]` (Lemma&nbsp;1), therefore the global optimum cannot exceed `max_i dp[i]`.  \nConversely, for the index `i` where `dp[i]` attains the maximum, the subarray\nrealising `dp[i]` is a valid subarray with that sum. Hence the maximum is\nexactly `max_i dp[i]`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nFor each test case the algorithm outputs the maximum possible sum of a\nnon‑empty subarray whose adjacent elements have opposite parity.\n\n**Proof.** By Lemma&nbsp;1 the algorithm computes correct `dp[i]` for every `i`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the maximum of these values is the desired answer, which the\nalgorithm prints. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

He likes electronic music most of all, so he has created his own system of music notes, which, in his opinion, is best for it.\n\nSince Yarik also likes informatics, in his system notes are denoted by integers of $2^k$, where $k \\ge 1$ — a positive integer. But, as you know, you can't use just notes to write music, so Yarik uses combinations of two notes. The combination of two notes $(a, b)$, where $a = 2^k$ and $b = 2^l$, he denotes by the integer $a^b$.\n\nFor example, if $a = 8 = 2^3$, $b = 4 = 2^2$, then the combination $(a, b)$ is denoted by the integer $a^b = 8^4 = 4096$. Note that different combinations can have the same notation, e.g., the combination $(64, 2)$ is also denoted by the integer $4096 = 64^2$.\n\nYarik has already chosen $n$ notes that he wants to use in his new melody. However, since their integers can be very large, he has written them down as an array $a$ of length $n$, then the note $i$ is $b_i = 2^{a_i}$. The integers in array $a$ can be repeated.\n\nThe melody will consist of several combinations of two notes. Yarik was wondering how many pairs of notes $b_i, b_j$ $(i < j)$ exist such that the combination $(b_i, b_j)$ is equal to the combination $(b_j, b_i)$. In other words, he wants to count the number of pairs $(i, j)$ $(i < j)$ such that $b_i^{b_j} = b_j^{b_i}$.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible OR.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any feasible distribution of shifts `(t0,…,tn‑1)` there exists another\ndistribution that uses the same total number of shifts, puts **all**\nshifts on a single index `j`, and does not decrease the final OR.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake a distribution with at least two indices receiving a positive number of\nshifts, say `p` and `q` (`tp>0, tq>0`).  \nConsider moving all shifts from `q` to `p` (i.e. set `tp' = tp + tq`,\n`tq' = 0`, all other `ti' = ti`).  \n\n*All bits contributed by indices different from `p` and `q` stay unchanged.*  \n*Index `p` only gains higher bits (because of the extra left shifts) and\nkeeps all its original bits at higher positions – it never loses a bit.*  \n*Index `q` becomes its original value (no shift), therefore all bits it\ncontributed before are still present (they are now contributed by `q` itself).*\n\nThus the OR after the move is a superset of the original OR, i.e. it does\nnot decrease. Repeating this argument merges all shifted indices into one.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed index `i` and a fixed number of shifts `t` the algorithm\ncomputes exactly the OR obtained by applying `t` shifts to `i` and none to\nany other element.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`others(i)` is the OR of all elements except `i` (definition of prefix/suffix\nOR). After shifting `i` by `t` its value becomes `nums[i] << t`.  \nThe total OR is the bitwise OR of these two independent parts, which the\nalgorithm evaluates as `(nums[i] << t) | others(i)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every feasible solution (any distribution of at most `k` shifts) the\nalgorithm examines a candidate with **the same** final OR.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake an optimal feasible solution.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 we can transform it without decreasing the OR into a solution\nthat puts all its shifts on a single index `i` (using `t ≤ k` shifts).  \nThe algorithm iterates over **all** indices `i` and over **all** `t` from\n`0` to `k`.  \nHence the pair `(i,t)` of the transformed solution is examined, and by\nLemma&nbsp;2 the corresponding candidate equals the OR of that solution. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe value returned by the algorithm is **at least** the value of an optimal\nsolution.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFrom Lemma&nbsp;3 the algorithm evaluates a candidate whose OR equals the OR\nof an optimal solution. The algorithm keeps the maximum over all candidates,\ntherefore its final answer is ≥ that optimal OR. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nThe value returned by the algorithm is **at most** the value of an optimal\nsolution.\n\n**Proof.**  \nEvery candidate considered by the algorithm corresponds to a concrete\ndistribution of shifts (apply `t` shifts to index `i`, none elsewhere), which\nis a feasible solution (uses ≤ k operations).  \nConsequently its OR cannot exceed the optimum. The maximum of a set of\nvalues each ≤ optimum is also ≤ optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`maximumOr` returns the maximum possible bitwise OR obtainable after at most\n`k` operations.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm’s answer is ≥ optimum, and by Lemma&nbsp;5 it is\n≤ optimum. Hence it equals the optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Their total contribution is `a[j]²·a[i]·2^{j-i-1}`.\nIf `i=j` the factor is `1` and the contribution is `a[i]³`.  \nSummation over all possible `(i , j)` therefore counts every subset once,\nand the total is precisely the expression of Lemma&nbsp;3. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`Solution.sumOfPower` returns the sum of the powers of all non‑empty\ngroups of heroes, modulo `10⁹+7`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm computes the value described in Lemma&nbsp;3.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 this value equals the required sum over all subsets.\nAll operations are performed modulo `MOD`, so the returned value is the\ndesired answer modulo `10⁹+7`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Because `1` never crosses `n`,\nthe two sequences of swaps are independent and can be performed one after\nthe other, achieving a total of `i + (n-1-j)` swaps.

Inside the loop we increase `left`\nuntil a pair that contributed to `cnt` leaves the window, decreasing `cnt`\nby one (Lemma&nbsp;1). Therefore each iteration reduces `cnt` by at least one.\nSince `cnt` is a non‑negative integer, after finitely many iterations\n`cnt ≤ 1` and the loop stops. By Lemma&nbsp;1 the window now has at most one\nequal pair. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every `right` the algorithm records the maximum length of a semi‑repetitive\nsubstring that ends at position `right`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWhen the outer loop is at a fixed `right`, after the inner `while` finishes\n(Lemma&nbsp;2) the current window `[left, right]` is the *longest* window ending\nat `right` that satisfies the constraint: any attempt to move `left` leftwards\nwould re‑introduce a second equal pair (otherwise the `while` would not have\nstopped). Hence its length `right-left+1` is exactly the maximum feasible\nlength for substrings ending at `right`. The algorithm updates `best` with this\nvalue, so `best` stores the maximum over all `right`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \n`best` at the end of the algorithm equals the length of the longest\nsemi‑repetitive substring of `s`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3, after processing each `right` the variable `best` is at least\nthe optimum length among substrings ending at that `right`. Taking the maximum\nover all `right` therefore yields a value that is **≥** the global optimum.\nConversely, any semi‑repetitive substring has some rightmost index `r`; when the\nalgorithm processes this `r`, the window `[left, r]` can be expanded to cover\nthe whole substring (because it contains ≤ 1 equal pair). Hence its length is\nconsidered for `best`. Thus `best` is also **≤** the global optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`longestSemiRepetitiveSubstring` returns the length of the longest semi‑repetitive\nsubstring of `s`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm terminates because `right` moves from `0` to `n‑1` and `left`\nonly moves forward. By Lemma&nbsp;4 the returned `best` equals the desired\nmaximum length. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\n*Time*: each pointer (`left`, `right`) moves at most `n` steps ⇒ **O(n)**.  \n*Space*: only a few integer variables ⇒ **O(1)**.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def longestSemiRepetitiveSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:\n        n = len(s)\n        left = 0          # left border of the sliding window\n        cnt = 0           # number of equal consecutive pairs inside the window\n        best = 0\n\n        for right in range(n):\n            # a new character enters the window, possibly creating a new pair\n            if right > 0 and s[right] == s[right - 1]:\n                cnt += 1\n\n            # shrink window until we have at most one pair\n            while cnt > 1:\n                # if the pair (left, left+1) is leaving, remove it from the count\n                if left + 1 <= right and s[left] == s[left + 1]:\n                    cnt -= 1\n                left += 1\n\n            # window [left, right] is now valid\n            best = max(best, right - left + 1)\n\n        return best\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms to\nthe required function signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: cannot assign to function call here.

If there are multiple palindromes that can be made using the minimum number of operations, make the lexicographically smallest one.\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.\nReturn the resulting palindrome string.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"egcfe\"\nOutput: \"efcfe\"\nExplanation: The minimum number of operations to make \"egcfe\" a palindrome is 1, and the lexicographically smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying one character is \"efcfe\", by changing 'g'.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abcd\"\nOutput: \"abba\"\nExplanation: The minimum number of operations to make \"abcd\" a palindrome is 2, and the lexicographically smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying two characters is \"abba\".\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"seven\"\nOutput: \"neven\"\nExplanation: The minimum number of operations to make \"seven\" a palindrome is 1, and the lexicographically smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying one character is \"neven\".\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\ns consists of only lowercase English letters.\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def makeSmallestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:\n        \n```\n\n ### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\n\n", "target": "", "sample_score": {"score": {"value": {"pass": 0.0}, "extracted_prediction": "index i          index n‑1‑i\n   s[i]   ↔   s[n‑1‑i]", "prediction": "**Solution Explanation**\n\nFor a palindrome the characters at symmetric positions must be equal:\n\n```\nindex i          index n‑1‑i\n   s[i]   ↔   s[n‑1‑i]\n```\n\nIf the two characters are already the same, no operation is needed.\nIf they differ, at least one of them has to be changed – otherwise the\nstring can never become a palindrome.\nChanging **both** would use two operations, which is never optimal because\nchanging only one already fixes the pair.\n\nSo the *minimum* number of operations is simply the number of mismatched\npairs, and for each mismatched pair we must change exactly one character.\n\nWhen several optimal palindromes exist we need the lexicographically\nsmallest one.\nFor a single mismatched pair `(a , b)` we have two optimal choices:\n\n* change `a` into `b`  → both become `b`\n* change `b` into `a`  → both become `a`\n\nThe resulting palindrome is smaller when the common character is the\nsmaller of `a` and `b`.  \nBecause the decision for each pair influences only its own two positions,\nchoosing the smaller character for **every** mismatched pair yields the\noverall lexicographically smallest palindrome among all optimal solutions.\n\nThus the algorithm is straightforward:\n\n```\nfor each i from 0 to n//2-1\n        j = n-1-i\n        if s[i] != s[j]:\n                c = min(s[i], s[j])\n                s[i] = s[j] = c\nreturn the modified string\n```\n\nThe middle character of an odd‑length string never participates in a pair\nand stays unchanged.\n\n---\n\n#### Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the required palindrome.\n\n*Lemma 1*  \nFor any index pair `(i, j = n‑1‑i)` the algorithm uses the minimum possible\nnumber of operations on that pair.\n\n*Proof.*  \nIf `s[i] == s[j]` the algorithm performs 0 operations, which is clearly\nminimal.  \nIf `s[i] != s[j]` the algorithm changes exactly one character, using 1\noperation. Any palindrome must have `s[i] == s[j]`; achieving this equality\nrequires at least one change, so 1 is minimal. ∎\n\n\n\n*Lemma 2*  \nIf a pair `(i, j)` is mismatched, setting both characters to `min(s[i], s[j])`\nproduces the lexicographically smallest possible palindrome among all\npalindromes that use the minimal number of operations on that pair.\n\n*Proof.*  \nThe two feasible optimal results are the two equal characters `a = s[i]`\nor `b = s[j]`. The resulting strings differ first at position `i` (or `j`,\nsymmetrically). The smaller character among `a` and `b` yields the smaller\nstring at that earliest differing position, therefore the whole string is\nlexicographically smaller. ∎\n\n\n\n*Lemma 3*  \nDecisions for different pairs are independent with respect to lexicographic\norder.\n\n*Proof.*  \nPairs are disjoint in indices. The first position where two candidate\npalindromes can differ belongs to the earliest pair where the algorithm\nchooses different characters. Changing any later pair cannot affect the\nordering determined by that earlier position. ∎\n\n\n\n*Theorem*  \nThe algorithm returns the palindrome that (1) requires the minimum possible\nnumber of character replacements, and (2) among all such palindromes is\nlexicographically smallest.\n\n*Proof.*  \n\n1. By Lemma&nbsp;1 each pair is fixed with the minimum number of operations.\n   Summing over all pairs gives the global minimum number of operations.\n\n2. Consider any optimal palindrome `P`. For each mismatched pair the\n   characters of `P` must both be either `s[i]` or `s[j]` (otherwise more\n   than one change would be used). By Lemma&nbsp;2 the algorithm chooses the\n   smaller of these two possibilities, which is lexicographically no larger\n   than the choice made in `P`. Because pairs are independent\n   (Lemma&nbsp;3), after processing all pairs the algorithm’s result is\n   lexicographically ≤ `P`. Since `P` was arbitrary among optimal\n   palindromes, the algorithm’s output is the lexicographically smallest\n   optimal palindrome. ∎\n\n\n\n---\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\nThe loop runs over `⌊n/2⌋` pairs, each in O(1) time.\n*Time*: **O(n)**  \n*Memory*: the string is converted to a list of characters → **O(n)**  \n(only the output string is stored).\n\n---\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def makeSmallestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Returns the lexicographically smallest palindrome that can be obtained\n        from `s` with the minimum number of character replacements.\n        \"\"\"\n        chars = list(s)\n        n = len(chars)\n        for i in range(n // 2):\n            j = n - 1 - i\n            if chars[i] != chars[j]:\n                # choose the smaller character for both positions\n                smaller = min(chars[i], chars[j])\n                chars[i] = chars[j] = smaller\n        return ''.join(chars)\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms\nto the required function signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: invalid character '\\u2011' (U+2011) (<string>, line 38)\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 29, "group_id": 29, "sample_metadata": null}}

By construction `A[n]=0`.  \nThen `p[i] = A[i] xor A[i+1]` (difference of two consecutive suffix xors) –\nthe first equivalence holds.  \n\nFrom (3) we have `B[j] = A[j] xor s[j]`. Because `B` is the prefix xor of `q`,\n`q[i] = B[i] xor B[i-1]`. Substituting `B` gives the second equivalence. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed binary array `A` the total cost of the corresponding operation\nset equals  \n\n```\nC(A) = Σ_{i=0}^{n-2} (i+1)·(A[i] xor A[i+1]) + n·A[n-1]\n       + Σ_{i=0}^{n-1} (n-i)·q[i]                (q[i] from Lemma 1)\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe first sum is exactly the definition of the cost of all chosen prefix\noperations (each `p[i]=1` costs `i+1`).  \nThe second sum is the definition of the cost of all chosen suffix\noperations (each `q[i]=1` costs `n-i`).  \nBoth expressions use the relations of Lemma 1, therefore they are the\ncost of the operation set that corresponds to `A`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a fixed target (all zeros or all ones) the DP described in Section&nbsp;4\ncomputes  \n\n```\ndp[i][a] =  min  C(A)   over all arrays A with A[i]=a and arbitrary\n                         values on positions > i\n```\n\n**Proof by induction on `i`.**\n\n*Base (`i=0`).*  \nOnly `q[0] = A[0] xor s[0]` contributes to the cost, with weight `n`.  \nThus `dp[0][a] = n·(a xor s[0])` is exactly the minimum possible cost for\narrays with `A[0]=a`.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement true for `i-1`.  \nConsider any array `A` with `A[i]=a`. Let `b = A[i-1]`.  \nThe part of the total cost that involves positions `≤ i` consists of\n\n* the optimal cost for the prefix `0 … i-1` with `A[i-1]=b` – this is\n  `dp[i-1][b]` by the induction hypothesis,\n* the cost of `p[i-1]` (weight `i`) – equals `i·(b xor a)`,\n* the cost of `q[i]` (weight `n-i`) – equals `(n-i)·((b xor a) xor diff[i])`.\n\nAll later positions are independent of these three terms.\nTherefore the cheapest array with `A[i]=a` is obtained by choosing the\nbest `b∈{0,1}` and adding exactly the three terms above, which is precisely\nthe transition used in the DP. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nAfter processing the whole string (`i = n-1`)  \n\n```\nanswerZero = min_{a∈{0,1}}  dp[n-1][a] + n·a\n```\n\nequals the minimum possible total cost to transform `s` into all zeros.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3, `dp[n-1][a]` is the minimum cost of all operations **except**\nthe last prefix operation `p[n-1]`, for arrays with `A[n-1]=a`.  \n`p[n-1] = A[n-1]` and its weight is `n`. Adding `n·a` gives the total cost\nfor the whole array. Taking the minimum over `a` yields the optimal cost. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nRunning the DP with initial value `s[0] xor 1` (i.e. flipping the first bit)\nproduces the minimum cost to transform `s` into all ones.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFlipping every bit of the target changes equation (1) to  \n`flips(j) = s[j] xor 1`. The derivation of Sections&nbsp;1‑4 stays unchanged,\nonly the constant term `s[0]` in the initialisation differs.\nThus the DP with start value `s[0] xor 1` computes exactly the optimum for the\nall‑ones target. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`min( answerZero , answerOne )` returned by the algorithm is the minimum\npossible total cost to make all characters of `s` equal.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`answerZero` is optimal for the all‑zeros target (Lemma&nbsp;4).  \n`answerOne` is optimal for the all‑ones target (Lemma&nbsp;5).  \nAny feasible sequence of operations makes the string either all zeros or all\nones, therefore its cost is at least the minimum of the two optimal values.\nConversely, the algorithm exhibits a concrete sequence of operations achieving\neach of the two values, so the minimum of them is attainable.\nHence the returned value is exactly the global optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.

The centre is never removed, so after each step at least one `c`\nremains. The process stops when only one `c` is left, having deleted exactly\n`f‑1` copies. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 3**  \nStarting from the original string we can obtain a string that contains **exactly\none occurrence of each distinct character**.\n\n*Proof.*  \nProcess the distinct characters one after another.\nFor the current character `c` apply Lemma&nbsp;2, which removes all but one\ncopy of `c`. Deletions only affect positions, never the set of characters,\nso later characters are still present and can be processed similarly.\nAfter all characters are processed the string consists of one copy of each\ndistinct letter. ∎\n\n\n\n**Theorem**  \nThe algorithm `len(set(s))` returns the minimum possible length of the string\nafter any number of allowed operations.\n\n*Proof.*  \n\n*Lower bound*: By Lemma&nbsp;1 any final string must contain at least one copy\nof each distinct character, therefore its length is at least `|set(s)|`.\n\n*Achievability*: By Lemma&nbsp;3 we can transform the original string into a\nstring of length exactly `|set(s)|`.\n\nSince the lower bound is attainable, it is optimal, and the algorithm returns\nthis value. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns `true` **iff** the required graph is\nconnected.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nIf two indices `i` and `j` share a prime factor `p`, after processing the\narray they belong to the same DSU set.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWhen the first index `k` containing `p` is encountered, `prime_first[p]` is\nset to `k`.  \nWhen a later index `i` containing `p` is processed, the algorithm executes\n`union(i, prime_first[p])`, i.e. `union(i, k)`.  \nAll later indices containing `p` are also united with `k`.  \nThus every index that contains `p` is in the same DSU component. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf there exists a path `i = v₀ – v₁ – … – v_m = j` in the original graph,\nthen after the algorithm finishes `i` and `j` are in the same DSU set.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFor each edge `v_t – v_{t+1}` we have `gcd(nums[v_t], nums[v_{t+1}]) > 1`,\nhence they share a prime factor `p_t`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1, `v_t` and `v_{t+1}` are united into the same DSU component.\nConsequently all vertices of the path belong to one component, in particular\n`i` and `j`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf two indices `i` and `j` are in the same DSU set after the algorithm,\nthere exists a path between them in the original graph.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBeing in the same DSU set means there is a sequence of union operations\nlinking them.  \nEach union operation was performed because the two involved indices share a\nprime factor `p`.  \nTherefore each union corresponds to an edge of the original graph.\nThe sequence of unions yields a walk `i = w₀ – w₁ – … – w_k = j`\nwhere every consecutive pair shares a prime factor, i.e. an edge.\nThus a path exists. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf the input contains a value `1` and `len(nums) > 1`, the graph is not\nconnected.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`gcd(1, x) = 1` for any integer `x`. Hence vertex of value `1` has degree `0`\nand cannot be reached from any other vertex. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns `true` **iff** for every pair of indices `i < j`\nthere exists a sequence of traversals (a path) from `i` to `j`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*(*If*)*  \nAssume the algorithm returns `true`.  \nThe early checks guarantee that no `1` exists (otherwise it would have\nreturned `false`).  \nAll DSU roots are equal, i.e. every pair of indices lies in the same DSU\nset.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 each such pair is connected by a path in the original graph.\nHence the required condition holds.\n\n*(*Only if*)*  \nAssume the required condition holds, i.e. the graph is connected.\nNo `1` can be present unless the array length is `1`; otherwise the vertex\n`1` would be isolated, contradicting connectivity.  \nThus the algorithm does not reject in the early `1` test.\nBecause the graph is connected, for any two indices there exists a path,\nso by Lemma&nbsp;2 they must end up in the same DSU component.\nConsequently all DSU roots are identical and the final check succeeds,\nmaking the algorithm return `true`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Its **rightmost**\noccurrence inside the whole prefix `0 … r` is either inside `[l , r]` or\nbefore `l`.\n\n*If it is inside `[l , r]`* then the BIT has a `1` at that position, which\ncontributes exactly one to the sum on `[l , r]`.\n*If it is before `l`* then the BIT has a `1` before `l`, contributing nothing\nto the sum on `[l , r]`.\n\nThus each distinct server that occurs in the interval contributes exactly\none to the sum, and no other server contributes. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a query `q` with interval `[L , R]` let `left, right` be the indices\nfound by binary search.  \nIf `left ≤ right`, the algorithm computes  \n\n```\ndistinct = number of distinct servers that received a request\n           at a time t with L ≤ t ≤ R .\n```\n\n**Proof.** By construction `servers[left … right]` is precisely the list of\nservers of all logs whose time lies in `[L , R]`.  \nWhen the offline scan reaches `right`, the BIT satisfies Lemma&nbsp;1.\nApplying Lemma&nbsp;2 to `[left , right]` yields the claimed `distinct`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf `left > right` (no log in the interval) the algorithm returns `n`.\n\n**Proof.** No server received a request in `[L , R]`. Therefore every one of\nthe `n` servers is idle, and the algorithm directly stores `answer = n`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nFor every query `queries[i]` the algorithm outputs the number of servers\nthat did **not** receive any request during the interval\n`[queries[i] – x , queries[i]]`.\n\n**Proof.** Two cases.\n\n*Case 1 – `left > right`.*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm returns `n`. Since no request exists in the\ninterval, all `n` servers are idle – correct.\n\n*Case 2 – `left ≤ right`.*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the algorithm obtains `distinct`, the number of servers that\n*did* receive at least one request in the interval.  \nIt outputs `n – distinct`.

Then, positions 2,6,7,8 are occupied.\nAt the i = 1st step, we move the marbles at position 7 to position 9. Then, positions 2,6,8,9 are occupied.\nAt the i = 2nd step, we move the marbles at position 2 to position 5. Then, positions 5,6,8,9 are occupied.\nAt the end, the final positions containing at least one marbles are [5,6,8,9].\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,3,3], moveFrom = [1,3], moveTo = [2,2]\nOutput: [2]\nExplanation: Initially, the marbles are at positions [1,1,3,3].\nAt the i = 0th step, we move all the marbles at position 1 to position 2. Then, the marbles are at positions [2,2,3,3].\nAt the i = 1st step, we move all the marbles at position 3 to position 2. Then, the marbles are at positions [2,2,2,2].\nSince 2 is the only occupied position, we return [2].\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 10^5\n1 <= moveFrom.length <= 10^5\nmoveFrom.length == moveTo.length\n1 <= nums[i], moveFrom[i], moveTo[i] <= 10^9\nThe test cases are generated such that there is at least a marble in moveFrom[i] at the moment we want to apply the i^th move.\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def relocateMarbles(self, nums: List[int], moveFrom: List[int], moveTo: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        \n```\n\n ### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\n\n", "target": "", "sample_score": {"score": {"value": {"pass": 0.0}, "extracted_prediction": "cnt[pos] = number of marbles on position pos", "prediction": "**Solution Explanation**\n\nFor every position we only need to know **how many** marbles are there.\nThe exact identity of the marbles is irrelevant, because a move always transfers *all*\nmarbles that are currently on a given position.\n\nTherefore we can keep a hash‑map  \n\n```\ncnt[pos] = number of marbles on position pos\n```\n\nand update it for each move:\n\n```\nmove i :  from = moveFrom[i] ,  to = moveTo[i]\n\nk = cnt[from]                 # k ≥ 1  (guaranteed by the statement)\ncnt[to]   = cnt.get(to,0) + k\ncnt[from] = 0                 # the position becomes empty\n```\n\nAfter processing all moves the occupied positions are exactly the keys whose\nvalue is positive.

Hence `cnt[p] > 0` exactly when at least one marble is present,\ni.e. when `p` is occupied. ∎\n\n\n\n*Theorem*  \nThe list returned by the algorithm (sorted keys of `cnt` with positive value)\nis exactly the sorted list of occupied positions after performing all moves.\n\n*Proof.*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2, the set `{ p | cnt[p] > 0 }` coincides with the set of occupied\npositions.

Searching the minimal `C`\n\n`C` is the answer we are looking for.  \nFrom the constraints (`i ≤ 60`) the biggest power we may use is `2^60`,\nhence any feasible `target` fits into 61 bits.  \nConsequently `popcount(target) ≤ 61`, so a feasible solution never needs\nmore than `61` operations.  \nWe simply try all `C = 1 … 60` (plus the trivial `C = 0` when `num1 = 0`)\nand return the first one that satisfies (2).\n\nIf none works, the task is impossible → return `-1`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible number of operations\nor `-1` when impossible.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a non‑negative integer `X` the smallest number of powers of two whose sum\nequals `X` is `popcount(X)`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWrite `X` in binary. Every `1`‑bit corresponds to a distinct power of two,\nand the sum of those powers equals `X`. No representation can use fewer\nterms, because each term contributes at most one `1`‑bit to the binary sum.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nLet `C` be a positive integer and `target = num1 – C·num2`.  \nThere exist non‑negative integers `ck` with `Σ ck = C` and\n`Σ ck·2^k = target` **iff** `popcount(target) ≤ C ≤ target`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If part.*  \nAssume the inequalities hold.\nTake the binary representation of `target`. It uses `popcount(target)` powers\nof two; set `ck = 1` for those bits and `0` otherwise.  \nNow we have `Σ ck = popcount(target) ≤ C`.  \nIf `C` is larger, repeatedly replace a power `2^i` (with `i>0`) by two\n`2^{i-1}` – this increases the total number of terms by one while keeping the\nsum unchanged. Repeating this operation we can reach exactly `C` terms,\nbecause the maximal possible number of terms is `target` (all `1`s).  \n\n*Only‑if part.*  \nIf such `ck` exist, then `target = Σ ck·2^k` is a sum of `C` powers of two,\nhence `C ≤ target`. Moreover at least one term is needed for each `1`‑bit,\nso `popcount(target) ≤ C`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf the algorithm returns a value `C`, then `C` operations are sufficient to\nmake `num1` zero.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm returns the smallest `C` (1 ≤ C ≤ 60) for which\n`target = num1 – C·num2` is non‑negative and satisfies the inequalities of\nLemma&nbsp;2. By Lemma&nbsp;2 there exist counts `ck` with `Σ ck = C` and\n`Σ ck·2^k = target`. Using each exponent `k` exactly `ck` times we subtract\n\n```\nΣ ck·(2^k + num2) = Σ ck·2^k + C·num2 = target + C·num2 = num1\n```\n\nfrom the original `num1`, reaching zero in exactly `C` steps. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf it is possible to reach zero in `k` operations, then the algorithm will\nreturn a value `C ≤ k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFrom a feasible sequence of `k` operations we obtain counts `ck` with\n`Σ ck = k` and `Σ ck·(2^k + num2) = num1`.  \nDefine `target = num1 – k·num2`. Then `target = Σ ck·2^k` is non‑negative.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1, `popcount(target) ≤ Σ ck = k`. Also `k ≤ target` because each\nterm `2^i ≥ 1`. Hence `target` and `k` satisfy the inequalities of Lemma&nbsp;2,\nso when the algorithm examines `C = k` it will accept it. Since it returns the\nfirst (smallest) acceptable `C`, the returned value `C` cannot be larger than\n`k`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns  \n\n* the minimum possible number of operations needed to make `num1` zero, or  \n* `-1` if no sequence of operations can achieve zero.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Existence.*  \nIf a solution exists, let `k_min` be the optimal (minimum) number of\noperations. By Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm will accept some `C ≤ k_min`.  \nBecause `k_min` is minimal, we must have `C = k_min`. By Lemma&nbsp;3 this\n`C` indeed yields a valid sequence, so the algorithm returns the optimum.\n\n*Impossibility.*  \nIf the algorithm finishes the loop without finding any `C`, then for every\n`1 ≤ C ≤ 60` the condition of Lemma&nbsp;2 fails, i.e. no representation of\n`num1` as a sum of `C` terms `2^i + num2` exists. Any feasible solution would\nneed at most 60 operations (otherwise the sum of at least 61 ones would exceed\n`num1`), contradicting the loop result. Hence no solution exists and the\nalgorithm correctly returns `-1`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

The segment tree maintains the maximum `a+b` for each leaf and for\nany interval the maximum of its children, therefore a query on an interval\nreturns the maximum among the leaves inside that interval.\n\nThe interval `[i , m‑1]` contains exactly the compressed indices of all\n`b` values that are **≥ y** (by definition of `lower_bound`).  \nConsequently the query returns the maximum `a+b` among stored points with\n`b ≥ y`. If no such leaf exists the tree stores the initial value `-1`,\nwhich is returned. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a processed query `(x, y)` the algorithm outputs  \n\n```\nmax { nums1[j] + nums2[j] | nums1[j] ≥ x  and  nums2[j] ≥ y }\n```\nor `-1` if the set is empty.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the tree contains exactly the points with `nums1 ≥ x`.  \nApplying Lemma&nbsp;2 on this set with the same `y` yields the maximum\n`nums1+nums2` among those points whose `nums2 ≥ y`.  \nIf no point satisfies both inequalities, the query result is `-1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nFor every query in the input the algorithm stores in `ans` the correct\nanswer required by the problem statement.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe queries are processed one after another; each query is answered\nindependently using the current state of the segment tree.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the value written to `ans[idx]` for the query with original\nindex `idx` is exactly the desired maximum (or `-1` if none exists).\nAll queries are eventually processed, therefore the final `ans` array is\ncorrect. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Computing the best cut  \n\nIf we cut after position `i` (`0 ≤ i < n‑1`)\n\n```\nnums1 = a0 … ai          → max(nums1) = ai\nnums2 = a(i+1) … a(n‑1)  → min(nums2) = a(i+1)\nvalue = a(i+1) – ai\n```\n\nBoth groups are non‑empty, therefore every `i` from `0` to `n‑2` is allowed.\nThe minimal possible value is simply the smallest difference of two neighbours\nin the sorted order.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.

Repeating this operation eliminates all\ninversions, leaving a prefix/suffix partition. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 2**  \nFor a cut after index `i` the partition value equals `sorted[i+1] – sorted[i]`.\n\n*Proof.*  \nAll elements left of the cut are ≤ `sorted[i]`, thus the maximum of the left\ngroup is exactly `sorted[i]`. All elements right of the cut are ≥ `sorted[i+1]`,\nso the minimum of the right group is `sorted[i+1]`. The value is their difference. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 3**  \nThe optimal partition value is `min_{0≤i<n-1} (sorted[i+1] – sorted[i])`.\n\n*Proof.*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 an optimal partition can be taken as a cut.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the value of a cut at `i` is the neighbour difference at `i`.  \nTherefore the smallest possible value among all cuts is exactly the minimum\nneighbour difference. ∎\n\n\n\n**Theorem**  \n`findValueOfPartition` returns the minimum possible value of a partition of `nums`.\n\n*Proof.*  \nThe algorithm sorts `nums` and computes the minimum of all neighbour differences,\nwhich by Lemma&nbsp;3 equals the optimal partition value.

By construction `rev` is the reversed string of `w`. Both strings are\ndifferent because `rev != w` is required, and they are distinct elements of the\noriginal array (the array contains distinct strings). Hence the pair satisfies\nthe definition. ∎\n\n\n\n*Lemma 2*  \nNo word is used in more than one pair by the algorithm.\n\n*Proof.*  \nWhenever a pair `{w, rev}` is created, both `w` and `rev` are removed from the\nset `S`. Subsequent iterations check membership in `S`; a removed word is no\nlonger present and therefore cannot be paired again. ∎\n\n\n\n*Lemma 3*  \nFor any optimal solution, the number of pairs is at most the number produced\nby the algorithm.\n\n*Proof.*  \nConsider the algorithm’s execution order. When it processes a word `w`,\nif its reverse `rev` is still unused (still in `S`), the algorithm creates the\npair `{w, rev}`. Any optimal solution must also pair `w` with `rev` (the only\npossible partner) or leave `w` unpaired. Pairing `w` with any other word is\nimpossible because the definition requires the reverse string. Therefore,\npairing `w` with `rev` never harms optimality; it is a *forced* choice.\nThe algorithm makes exactly those forced choices, removing both words.\nRepeating this argument for every step shows that the algorithm never discards\na pairing that could belong to an optimal solution. Hence the number of pairs\nfound by the algorithm is at least the number in any optimal solution. ∎\n\n\n\n*Theorem*  \nThe algorithm returns the maximum possible number of disjoint string pairs.\n\n*Proof.*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 every pair produced by the algorithm is valid, and by Lemma&nbsp;2\npairs are disjoint, so the algorithm’s output is a feasible solution.\nLemma&nbsp;3 shows that no feasible solution can contain more pairs than the\nalgorithm’s solution.

The only permutation is `[nums[i]]`, which trivially satisfies\nthe condition. The algorithm sets `dp[1<<i][i] = 1`. So the statement holds.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement true for all masks of size `k` (`k ≥ 1`).  \nTake a mask `M` of size `k+1` and a `last ∈ M`. Remove `last` from `M`,\nlet `prevMask = M \\ {last}`. Any valid permutation of `M` ending with\n`last` can be written uniquely as  \n\n```\n(valid permutation of prevMask ending with some prev) + last\n```\n\nwhere `prev` is the element placed just before `last`.  \nThe adjacency condition between `prev` and `last` must hold, otherwise the\nwhole permutation would be invalid.\n\nConversely, for every `prev` with an edge `prev ↔ last`,\nevery valid permutation counted in `dp[prevMask][prev]` can be extended by\nappending `last`, producing a distinct valid permutation of `M` ending with\n`last`.\n\nThe transition of the algorithm adds exactly `dp[prevMask][prev]` to\n`dp[M][last]` for each such `prev`. By the induction hypothesis the added\nvalue equals the number of permutations that can be extended, therefore after\nprocessing all `prev` the total stored in `dp[M][last]` equals the number of\nvalid permutations of `M` ending with `last`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nWhen the DP finishes, for the full mask `FULL = (1<<n)-1`,\n`dp[FULL][i]` equals the number of special permutations whose last element is\n`nums[i]`.\n\n**Proof.** Directly from Lemma&nbsp;1 with `mask = FULL`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe sum `Σ_i dp[FULL][i]` equals the total number of special permutations of\n`nums`.\n\n**Proof.** Every special permutation has a unique last element, therefore it\ncontributes to exactly one term of the sum. Conversely, each term counts only\npermutations that are special (Lemma&nbsp;2). Hence the sum counts each special\npermutation exactly once. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`answer` returned by the algorithm is exactly the number of special\npermutations of `nums` (mod `10^9+7`).\n\n**Proof.** By Lemma&nbsp;3 the (non‑modular) sum of the DP entries for the full\nmask equals the desired count. The algorithm computes the same sum while\nperforming all additions modulo `M`; modular reduction does not change the\nresult modulo `M`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the required sum.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nWhen a new distinct value `x` is inserted into the current set `S`,\nlet `p` be the predecessor of `x` in `S` (or none) and `s` the successor\n(or none).  \nThe imbalance changes by  \n\n```\nΔ =  (gap(p,x) if p exists) + (gap(x,s) if s exists) – (gap(p,s) if both exist)\n```\n\nwhere `gap(a,b) = 1` iff `b-a > 1`, otherwise `0`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll gaps of `S` that do **not** involve `p` or `s` stay unchanged.\nThe only gap that disappears is the one between `p` and `s`\n(if both exist).  \nTwo new gaps appear: `p‑x` and `x‑s` (if the corresponding neighbour\nexists). Their contributions are exactly the three terms above. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nDuring the inner loop the variable `cur` always equals the imbalance of\nthe sub‑array `nums[left … right]`.\n\n**Proof by induction over `right`.**\n\n*Base (`right = left`).*  \nThe sub‑array contains a single element, its set of distinct values has\nsize `1`, therefore imbalance `0`.  \nThe algorithm starts with `cur = 0`, so the invariant holds.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the invariant holds for `right`.  \nWhen we extend to `right+1` we add `x = nums[right+1]`.\n\n* If `x` is already present, the set of distinct values does not change,\n  consequently the imbalance does not change.\n  The algorithm does not modify `cur` – invariant preserved.\n\n* If `x` is new, the algorithm finds `p` and `s` (predecessor / successor)\n  among the previously present values, computes the three terms of\n  Lemma&nbsp;1 and updates `cur` exactly by `Δ`.  \n  By Lemma&nbsp;1 the new `cur` equals the new imbalance.\n\nThus the invariant holds for all `right`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every pair `(left,right)` the algorithm adds to `ans` exactly the\nimbalance of sub‑array `nums[left … right]`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWhen the inner loop reaches this pair, by Lemma&nbsp;2 `cur` equals the\nimbalance of that sub‑array, and the algorithm executes `ans += cur`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the sum of imbalance numbers of **all**\nsub‑arrays of `nums`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll sub‑arrays are enumerated once by the two nested loops\n(`left` from `0` to `n-1`, `right` from `left` to `n-1`).  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 each of them contributes its imbalance to `ans`.  \nTherefore after the loops finish `ans` equals the required sum,\nwhich the algorithm returns. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Repeating this for all blocks yields exactly the described\npath. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf a state `(a,b,c,last)` is reachable in the graph, then there exists a\nfeasible concatenation that uses exactly `a` copies of `AA`,\n`b` copies of `BB` and `c` copies of `AB`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nInduction over the length of the path that reaches the state.\n\n*Base.* The start state corresponds to the empty concatenation – feasible.\n\n*Induction step.* Assume the claim holds for a state `S`.  \nIf we extend the path by one allowed edge, we append a block that does not\ncreate `AAA`/`BBB` (Lemma&nbsp;1).  \nThus the new concatenation is still feasible and uses the counters of the\nnew state. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \n`maxBlocks` computed by the algorithm equals the maximum possible number of\nblocks that can be used in any feasible concatenation.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Upper bound.*  \nEvery feasible concatenation corresponds (Lemma&nbsp;2) to a reachable state,\nso its number of blocks is ≤ the maximum `a+b+c` among reachable states,\ni.e. ≤ `maxBlocks`.\n\n*Lower bound.*  \nFor the state that attains `maxBlocks` the algorithm has visited it,\nhence it is reachable. By Lemma&nbsp;3 there exists a feasible concatenation\nusing exactly `maxBlocks` blocks.\n\nThus `maxBlocks` is both an upper and a lower bound and therefore optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`longestString` returns the maximum possible length of a string that can be\nobtained by concatenating the given blocks without containing `AAA` or\n`BBB`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm returns `2 * maxBlocks`.  \nEach block contributes two characters, so any concatenation using `k` blocks\nhas length `2k`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 `maxBlocks` is the largest achievable `k`.  \nConsequently `2 * maxBlocks` is the largest achievable length. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Hence, the answer is 2.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: words = [\"aaa\",\"c\",\"aba\"]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: In this example, we can perform join operations in the following order to minimize the length of str_2: \nstr_0 = \"aaa\"\nstr_1 = join(str_0, \"c\") = \"aaac\"\nstr_2 = join(\"aba\", str_1) = \"abaaac\"\nIt can be shown that the minimum possible length of str_2 is 6.\n\n \n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= words.length <= 1000\n1 <= words[i].length <= 50\nEach character in words[i] is an English lowercase letter\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimizeConcatenatedLength(self, words: List[str]) -> int:\n        \n```\n\n ### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\n\n", "target": "", "sample_score": {"score": {"value": {"pass": 0.0}, "extracted_prediction": "join(left , right) = left + right               (no overlap)\njoin(left , right) = left + right[1:]           (overlap, because last(left)==first(right))", "prediction": "**Solution Explanation**\n\nFor a string `x` we only need to know  \n\n* its first character `first(x)`  \n* its last character `last(x)`  \n* its length `len(x)`\n\nbecause the *join* operation only looks at the last character of the left\noperand and the first character of the right operand.\n\n```\njoin(left , right) = left + right               (no overlap)\njoin(left , right) = left + right[1:]           (overlap, because last(left)==first(right))\n```\n\nSo after joining we can compute the new length only from the three values\nabove, and we can also compute the new first / last characters.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 1.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible length.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any string `s` that can appear as `str_i` during the process,\nits length, first character and last character are sufficient to determine\nthe length of the string obtained after joining `s` with the next word\n`w` (either `join(s,w)` or `join(w,s)`).\n\n**Proof.**  \n`join` only checks whether `last(s) == first(w)` (or `last(w) == first(s)`)\nand possibly removes one character. The rest of the characters are simply\nconcatenated, therefore the resulting length is\n\n```\nlen(s) + len(w) - (1 if the compared characters are equal else 0)\n```\n\nwhich depends only on `len(s)`, `first(s)`, `last(s)`, `first(w)`, `last(w)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nAfter processing the first `i` words (`i ≥ 0`), for every pair of letters\n`(f,l)` the table entry `dp[f][l]` equals the minimum possible length of a\nstring `str_i` whose first character is `f` and last character is `l`.\n\n**Proof by induction on `i`.**\n\n*Base (`i = 0`).*  \n`str_0` is exactly `words[0]`. The algorithm stores its length at the\ncorresponding `(f,l)` and `∞` elsewhere, which is clearly optimal.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement true for `i‑1`.  \nConsider any feasible string `S` that can be obtained after processing the\nfirst `i` words and whose first/last characters are `(f,l)`.  \n`S` is produced from some feasible string `P` after `i‑1` words\n(by the definition of the process) and the `i`‑th word `w = words[i]`,\nusing one of the two allowed join directions.\n\n*Case 1 – `S = join(P, w)`.*  \nLet `P` have first/last `(f_P , l_P)`. By Lemma&nbsp;1 the length of `S`\nis `len(P) + len(w) - (1 if l_P == w[0] else 0)`.  \nBy the induction hypothesis `len(P) ≥ dp[f_P][l_P]`.  \nThe transition of the algorithm exactly computes this length and tries to\nstore it into `next_dp[f_P][w[-1]]`. Hence `next_dp[f][l]` is ≤ the length of\n`S`.\n\n*Case 2 – `S = join(w, P)`* is analogous and handled by the second\ntransition.\n\nThus for every feasible `S` the algorithm creates a candidate of the same\nlength, and `next_dp[f][l]` becomes the minimum over all those candidates.\nConsequently `next_dp[f][l]` equals the optimal length for `(f,l)` after\n`i` words. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nAfter the last word (`i = n‑1`) the minimum value among all entries of `dp`\nequals the minimum possible length of `str_{n-1}`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 each entry `dp[f][l]` is the optimal length among strings\nwith that particular first/last pair. The overall optimum must have some\nfirst and last characters, therefore it appears as one of the entries.\nTaking the minimum over the whole table yields exactly that optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minimizeConcatenatedLength` returns the smallest possible length of the\nfinal string after performing the allowed join operations.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm initializes `dp` correctly for `i = 0`.  \nRepeatedly applying the transition maintains the invariant of Lemma&nbsp;2.\nAfter processing all words, Lemma&nbsp;3 shows that the answer taken from\nthe table is the global optimum. Hence the returned integer is the desired\nminimum length. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.

The only sequence ending at `0` is the empty\none, which uses `0` jumps – optimal.\n\n*Induction step.* Assume the statement holds for all indices `< i`.  \nConsider any valid sequence `S` that ends at `i`. Let `j` be the index\nimmediately before `i` in `S`. By definition of a valid jump,\n`j < i` and the value‑difference condition holds.\nThe prefix of `S` ending at `j` is a valid sequence to `j`, therefore by the\ninduction hypothesis it uses at most `dp[j]` jumps.\nConsequently `S` uses at most `dp[j] + 1` jumps.\nOur transition examines **all** such `j` and stores the maximum of\n`dp[j] + 1`, thus `dp[i]` is at least the number of jumps of any valid\nsequence to `i`.\n\nConversely, the transition only creates a value `dp[j] + 1` from a predecessor\n`j` that is reachable (`dp[j] ≠ -1`) and satisfies the jump condition,\nso the constructed number of jumps corresponds to an actually realizable\nsequence. Hence `dp[i]` cannot be larger than the optimum.\n\nTherefore `dp[i]` equals the optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf `dp[n‑1] = -1` then no valid sequence reaches the last index.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`dp[n‑1] = -1` means that during the transition for `i = n‑1` no predecessor\n`j` satisfied both the jump condition and `dp[j] ≠ -1`.  \nThus there is no reachable index that can legally jump to `n‑1`.  \nSince any sequence ending at `n‑1` must use such a predecessor, none exists. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns  \n\n* the maximum possible number of jumps from index `0` to index `n‑1`\n  if such a sequence exists,  \n\n* `-1` otherwise.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf a sequence exists, by Lemma&nbsp;1 `dp[n‑1]` equals the maximum number of\njumps among all valid sequences, and the algorithm returns it.  \nIf no sequence exists, Lemma&nbsp;2 shows `dp[n‑1] = -1`, and the algorithm\nreturns `-1`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\n`n ≤ 1000`.\n\nThe double loop checks every pair `(j,i)` with `j < i` once:\n\n*Time* : `O(n²)` ≤ `10⁶` operations – easily fast enough.  \n*Memory*: `O(n)` for the `dp` array.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumJumps(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        # dp[i] = max jumps to reach i, -1 = unreachable\n        dp = [-1] * n\n        dp[0] = 0                     # start position\n\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            best = -1\n            for j in range(i):\n                if dp[j] == -1:\n                    continue\n                diff = nums[i] - nums[j]\n                if -target <= diff <= target:\n                    # a legal jump from j to i\n                    best = max(best, dp[j] + 1)\n            dp[i] = best\n\n        return dp[-1]                 # -1 if unreachable, else max jumps\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms to\nthe required function signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: invalid character '\\u2264' (U+2264) (<string>, line 38)\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 49, "group_id": 49, "sample_metadata": null}}

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the exact number of complete subarrays.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nDuring the execution, for each `left` the variable `right` is the smallest index `≥ left-1` such that the window `nums[left … right]` contains `distinct` distinct values.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*Initialization*: before the first iteration `left = 0`, `right = -1`. The window is empty, which indeed is the smallest window with `distinct = 0`.  \n\n*Maintenance*:  \nWhen the loop body starts, the window is `nums[left … right]`.  \nThe inner `while` enlarges `right` step by step until `distinct` becomes `D` (or the array ends). Because we only increase `right`, the first moment `distinct` reaches `D` is exactly the minimal `right` with that property.  \n\nAfter counting the answer we remove `nums[left]`. This possibly decreases `distinct`. The next outer iteration will have `left' = left+1`. The current `right` is still `≥ left'‑1`. If `distinct` dropped, the inner `while` will again increase `right` until the minimal index with `distinct = D` is reached. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed `left`, if after the inner `while` we have `distinct == D` and the current `right = r₀`, then **every** subarray `nums[left … r]` with `r ≥ r₀` is complete.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`nums[left … r₀]` already contains all `D` distinct values of the whole array. Adding more elements to the right cannot introduce a new distinct value (there is none outside the whole array). Hence the set of distinct values stays exactly the same, i.e. still `D`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a fixed `left`, the algorithm adds exactly the number of complete subarrays that start at `left` to `answer`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf after the inner `while` we have `distinct < D`, then no subarray starting at `left` can be complete, and the algorithm adds nothing – correct.  \n\nOtherwise `distinct == D` and `right = r₀` is the minimal right border (Lemma&nbsp;1). By Lemma&nbsp;2 all subarrays `nums[left … r]` with `r ≥ r₀` are complete, and there are `n - r₀` of them. The algorithm adds exactly `n - right = n - r₀`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nEvery complete subarray of `nums` is counted exactly once.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake any complete subarray `nums[l … r]`.  \nWhen the outer loop reaches `left = l`, Lemma&nbsp;1 guarantees that `right` will be moved to the minimal index `r₀` with `distinct = D`. Because `nums[l … r]` is complete, `r₀ ≤ r`. Consequently the algorithm adds `n - r₀` to the answer, which includes the subarray ending at `r`.  \n\nFor any other `left' ≠ l` the subarray `nums[l … r]` does **not** start at `left'`, therefore it is not counted in that iteration. Hence it is counted exactly once. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nAfter the loop finishes, `answer` equals the total number of complete subarrays of `nums`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 each iteration adds the exact number of complete subarrays that start at the current `left`. By Lemma&nbsp;4 these sets are disjoint and together cover all complete subarrays. Summing over all `left` yields the total count, which is stored in `answer`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

No other strategy can use more fuel, because fuel can only be taken from\nthe main tank and the only way to obtain extra fuel is the mandatory injection\nafter each 5 L block, which the algorithm already performs (Lemma&nbsp;1).  \nConsequently the total fuel consumed by the algorithm is maximal.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the returned distance is exactly `10 km` per liter of that\nmaximal fuel, therefore it is the maximal possible distance. ∎\n\n\n\n---\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def distanceTraveled(self, mainTank: int, additionalTank: int) -> int:\n        \"\"\"\n        Simulate the consumption of fuel according to the problem statement\n        and return the total distance travelled.\n        \"\"\"\n        distance = 0          # total kilometres travelled\n        main = mainTank\n        add = additionalTank\n\n        # consume fuel while there is any in the main tank\n        while main > 0:\n            if main >= 5:\n                # use a full block of 5 litres\n                distance += 5 * 10\n                main -= 5\n\n                # injection from the additional tank, if possible\n                if add > 0:\n                    add -= 1\n                    main += 1\n            else:\n                # less than 5 litres left – consume them all and finish\n                distance += main * 10\n                main = 0\n\n        return distance\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms to the\nrequired function signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: invalid decimal literal (<string>, line 39)\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 51, "group_id": 51, "sample_metadata": null}}

Consequently the decision for one gap does not restrict the\ndecisions for any other gap. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf the array contains `k` ones (`k ≥ 1`), the number of good splits equals  \n\\[\n\\prod_{i=1}^{k-1} (g_i + 1)\n\\]\nwhere `g_i` is the number of zeros between the `i`‑th and `(i+1)`‑st `1`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 each gap contributes exactly `g_i+1` possibilities.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the total number of global configurations is the product of\nthe independent numbers of possibilities for all gaps. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm computes the product described in Lemma&nbsp;3.\n\n**Proof.**  \nDuring the scan the variable `prev` stores the index of the previously\nencountered `1`. When a new `1` at index `i` is found, `gap = i - prev - 1`\nis precisely the number of zeros between the two consecutive `1`s.\nThe algorithm multiplies `answer` by `gap+1` (modulo `MOD`).  \nThus after processing all `1`s, `answer` equals the product over all gaps. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`numberOfGoodSubarraySplits` returns the exact number of ways to split\n`nums` into good sub‑arrays (mod \\(10^9+7\\)).\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If the array contains no `1`* (`k = 0`), a good sub‑array would need a `1`,\nwhich is impossible, so the correct answer is `0`. The algorithm returns `0`.\n\n*If `k ≥ 1`*, by Lemma&nbsp;3 the correct answer is the product over all gaps.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm computes exactly this product (modulo `MOD`).\nTherefore the returned value equals the required number of splits. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the number of continuous subarrays.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nAt any moment the deques `maxDeque` and `minDeque` contain exactly the elements\nof the current window `[left, right]` in decreasing / increasing order,\nand their fronts are respectively the maximum and minimum of the window.\n\n**Proof.**  \nInsertion: when a new element `x = nums[right]` is added, all smaller elements\nat the back of `maxDeque` are removed – they can never become the maximum while\n`x` stays in the window. Then `x` is appended, preserving decreasing order.\nThe same argument holds for `minDeque`.  \n\nDeletion: when `left` moves forward, the element leaving the window is\n`nums[left]`. If it equals the front of a deque, that front is popped; otherwise\nthe element is somewhere inside the deque and will be removed later when a\nlarger (or smaller) element arrives. Hence after the pop the deque still\nrepresents the remaining window elements in the correct order. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nDuring the algorithm the invariant `maxDeque[0] - minDeque[0] ≤ 2` holds\nfor the current window `[left, right]`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe invariant is true after the initialisation (`left = 0, right = -1`).  \nWhen `right` is increased, we first insert the new element into the deques.\nIf the invariant becomes false, we repeatedly increase `left` and discard the\nleaving element from the deques (Lemma&nbsp;1). Each increment can only\ndecrease the maximum or increase the minimum, therefore the difference\n`max - min` is non‑increasing while we move `left`. The loop stops exactly\nwhen the invariant is restored. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor each index `right`, after the inner while‑loop finishes,\n`left` is the smallest index such that subarray `[left, right]` is continuous.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the final window `[left, right]` satisfies the condition,\nso it is a continuous subarray.  \nAssume there exists `l' < left` with `[l', right]` also continuous.\nWhen `left` was moved from `l'` to `l'+1`, the element `nums[l']` left the\nwindow. Since `[l', right]` was continuous, after removing `nums[l']`\nthe window `[l'+1, right]` would still satisfy `max-min ≤ 2`,\ncontradicting the fact that the algorithm only moves `left` while the\ncondition is violated. Hence no such `l'` exists and `left` is minimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm adds exactly the number of continuous subarrays that end at\nposition `right`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the valid starting positions for a subarray ending at `right`\nare precisely `left, left+1, … , right`. Their count is `right-left+1`,\nwhich the algorithm adds to the answer. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the total number of continuous subarrays of `nums`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nSumming over all `right = 0 … n-1`, Lemma&nbsp;4 counts every continuous\nsubarray exactly once – namely when its right endpoint is processed.\nNo non‑continuous subarray is ever counted because the algorithm only adds\nsubarrays belonging to a window that satisfies the condition (Lemma&nbsp;2).\nTherefore the final sum equals the required total. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the length of the longest possible\nnon‑decreasing subarray.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor every index `i` the values `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` equal the maximum\nlength of a feasible subarray that ends at `i` and uses respectively\n`nums1[i]` or `nums2[i]` as its last element.\n\n**Proof.** By induction over `i`.\n\n*Base (`i = 0`).*  \nA subarray ending at position `0` can contain only this element, therefore\nits length is `1`. The algorithm sets `dp1[0] = dp2[0] = 1`, which is optimal.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement holds for index `i‑1`.  \nConsider a feasible subarray `S` that ends at `i` and uses `nums1[i]`.\nLet the element just before `i` be at position `i‑1` and be either\n`nums1[i‑1]` or `nums2[i‑1]`.  \nIf it is `nums1[i‑1]` then we must have `nums1[i‑1] ≤ nums1[i]`; the part of\n`S` that ends at `i‑1` is a feasible subarray counted by `dp1[i‑1]`.  \nAnalogously, if the previous element is `nums2[i‑1]` we need\n`nums2[i‑1] ≤ nums1[i]` and the prefix length is `dp2[i‑1]`.  \nConsequently the length of `S` is at most  \n\n```\n1 + max( dp1[i-1] (if nums1[i-1] ≤ nums1[i]),\n         dp2[i-1] (if nums2[i-1] ≤ nums1[i]) )\n```\n\nThe algorithm constructs exactly this value, therefore no longer\nsubarray exists and the value is attainable (by extending the longer\nprefix that satisfies the inequality).  \nThus `dp1[i]` is optimal. The same argument works for `dp2[i]`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor any index `i` the longest feasible subarray that ends at `i`\nhas length `max(dp1[i], dp2[i])`.\n\n**Proof.** Any feasible subarray ending at `i` must end with either\n`nums1[i]` or `nums2[i]`. By Lemma&nbsp;1 the longest one of the first kind\nhas length `dp1[i]`, the longest of the second kind has length `dp2[i]`.\nTaking the larger of the two yields the overall optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nLet `Ans` be the maximum value taken by the algorithm over all positions.\n`Ans` equals the length of the longest feasible subarray in the whole\narray.\n\n**Proof.** By Lemma&nbsp;2, for each position `i` the longest feasible\nsubarray that ends at `i` has length `max(dp1[i],dp2[i])`.  \nThe overall longest feasible subarray ends at some index `j`; its length\nis therefore `max(dp1[j],dp2[j])`.  \nThe algorithm records the maximum of exactly these quantities, hence\n`Ans` equals that length. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`maxNonDecreasingLength` returns the maximum possible length of a\nnon‑decreasing subarray that can be obtained by choosing at each index\neither `nums1[i]` or `nums2[i]`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm computes `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` using the recurrence proved\ncorrect in Lemma&nbsp;1, iterates over all indices, and finally returns the\nmaximum value `Ans`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 this `Ans` is precisely the length of the longest feasible\nsubarray.

Otherwise no alternating subarray can end\nat `i+1`, we keep `cur = 1`. In both sub‑cases `cur` is exactly the\nlongest alternating subarray ending at `i+1`.\n\n*Case 2 – `cur > 1`* (there is an alternating subarray ending at `i`).  \nThe expected sign for the next difference is `+1` when `cur` is odd,\n`-1` when `cur` is even (derived from the pattern).  \n\n* If `diff` matches the expectation, the previous alternating subarray\ncan be extended by `nums[i+1]`; its length becomes `cur+1`, which we store\nin `cur`. This is clearly the longest alternating subarray ending at\n`i+1`.\n\n* If `diff` does **not** match, the previous subarray cannot be extended.\nThe only possible alternating subarray ending at `i+1` is a new one that\nstarts at `i` and therefore needs `diff == 1`.  \n  * If `diff == 1` we set `cur = 2`, otherwise `cur = 1`.  \n  Both choices give the correct maximal length ending at `i+1`.\n\nThus the invariant holds for iteration `i`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nDuring the whole execution `ans` equals the maximum length of any\nalternating subarray seen so far.\n\n**Proof.** `ans` is updated only by `ans = max(ans, cur)` immediately\nafter `cur` has been set to the length of an alternating subarray\n(see Lemma&nbsp;1). Therefore `ans` is always the maximum of all those\nlengths, i.e. the maximum length of any alternating subarray that ends\nat some processed position. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the length of the longest alternating subarray\nin `nums`, or `-1` if none exists.\n\n**Proof.** By Lemma&nbsp;1, after the last iteration `cur` holds the\nlength of the longest alternating subarray that ends at the last index.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;2, `ans` is the maximum over *all* ending positions, i.e.\nthe length of the overall longest alternating subarray.\nIf no alternating subarray of length at least 2 exists, `ans` is never\nupdated and stays `-1`.

Greedy construction from the right  \n\nWe scan the array from the rightmost element to the left.\n\n```\ncur  – sum of the current block that we are trying to merge into one element\nans  – the maximum block sum seen so far\n```\n\n* start with the last element: `cur = nums[-1] , ans = cur`\n* for each `i` from `n-2` down to `0`\n    * if `nums[i] ≤ cur`  \n      we can attach `nums[i]` to the current block → `cur += nums[i]`\n    * otherwise `nums[i]` is too large, it **cannot** be merged into the\n      current block, so we start a new block: `cur = nums[i]`\n    * update `ans = max(ans, cur)`\n\nWhy is this optimal?\n*If `nums[i] ≤ cur` we *must* be able to merge it*: after all elements to the\nright of `i` have already been merged into a single value `cur`,\nthe condition of the operation is satisfied, therefore we can finally merge\n`i` as well. Keeping it separate would only give a smaller maximal element.\n*If `nums[i] > cur`* then no matter how we order the merges, when `nums[i]`\nbecomes the left neighbour of the already‑merged right part, the required\ninequality fails, so `i` can never belong to the same final element.\nHence a new block has to start at `i`.\n\nThus the algorithm builds exactly the largest possible block sums, and the\nmaximum of them is the answer.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.  Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the value of the largest element that\ncan appear after any sequence of allowed operations.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any contiguous block `B = nums[l … r]` let `S(k)` be the sum of the\nsuffix `nums[k … r]` (`l ≤ k ≤ r`).  \n`B` can be merged into a single element **iff** `nums[k] ≤ S(k+1)` for every\n`k` with `l ≤ k < r`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*If*: Process the block from right to left. When we are at position `k`,\nthe right part `nums[k+1 … r]` has already been merged into a single element\nwith value `S(k+1)`. Because `nums[k] ≤ S(k+1)`, the operation is allowed,\nso we can merge `k` into it. Repeating yields a single element of value\n`S(l)`, the total sum.\n\n*Only‑if*: Suppose the block can be merged. Look at the moment just before\nthe element at position `k` is merged (it must be merged at some step,\notherwise the block would stay split). At that moment the element to its\nright is exactly the sum of the original suffix `k+1 … r`, i.e. `S(k+1)`.\nThe operation requires `nums[k] ≤ S(k+1)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nDuring the right‑to‑left scan the variable `cur` always equals the sum of the\nlargest block that ends at the current index `i` and satisfies the condition\nof Lemma&nbsp;1.\n\n**Proof.**  \nInduction on the scan.\n\n*Base*: before the loop `i = n‑1`, `cur = nums[n‑1]`. The block consisting of\nonly this element trivially satisfies Lemma&nbsp;1, and it is the largest\nsuch block ending at `i`.\n\n*Induction step*: assume the claim holds after processing index `i+1`\n(`cur = sum of the maximal valid block ending at i+1`).  \nNow we consider `i`.\n\n*Case 1*: `nums[i] ≤ cur`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the block ending at `i+1` can be extended leftwards,\nso the block `nums[i …]` is also valid and its sum is `cur + nums[i]`.\nThe algorithm sets `cur ← cur + nums[i]`, which is exactly that sum,\nand it is clearly the largest valid block ending at `i`.\n\n*Case 2*: `nums[i] > cur`.  \nThen any block that contains `i` and also contains the element at `i+1`\nwould violate Lemma&nbsp;1 at position `i`. Hence no valid block ending at\n`i` can extend beyond `i`; the only possible block is the single element\n`[i]`. The algorithm sets `cur ← nums[i]`, which is the sum of that block\nand is maximal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \n`ans` equals the maximum sum of any block that can be merged into a single\nelement.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2, at each iteration `cur` is the sum of the maximal valid\nblock ending at the current index. `ans` stores the maximum of all values\ntaken by `cur`, therefore it is the maximum over *all* valid blocks. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the largest possible element value obtainable after\nany sequence of allowed operations.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*Existence*: For the block whose sum equals `ans` (Lemma&nbsp;3) Lemma&nbsp;1\nguarantees that it can be merged into a single element of exactly that sum.\nThus a final array containing an element of value `ans` is achievable.\n\n*Optimality*: Any element that appears in a final array must be the result\nof merging some contiguous block of the original array (the rightmost\noriginal element of that block survives). By Lemma&nbsp;1 the block must be\nvalid, hence its sum cannot exceed the maximum sum of a valid block,\nwhich is `ans` (Lemma&nbsp;3). Therefore no larger element is possible.\n\nConsequently the algorithm’s output `ans` is exactly the required answer. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns exactly the shortest possible\nsuperstring and, if several exist, the lexicographically smallest one.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \n`merge(x , y)` is the shortest string that contains both `x` and `y`\nas substrings; if several strings have that length, `merge` returns the\nlexicographically smallest of them.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll possibilities for a superstring of two strings are:\n\n* one string already contains the other – handled by the first two\n  checks,\n* the two strings overlap with a suffix/prefix of length `k (1…min)`,\n  producing `x + y[k:]` or `y + x[k:]`,\n* they do not overlap at all, producing `x + y`.\n\nThe algorithm enumerates **all** these possibilities, computes their\nlengths and keeps the best according to the required order.\nNo other construction can be shorter, because any superstring must be\none of the listed forms. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nLet `p = (p0 , p1 , p2)` be a permutation of `{a,b,c}`.\n`S = merge( merge(p0 , p1) , p2 )` is the shortest superstring whose\nfirst occurrence among the three strings is `p0`, the second is `p1`,\nthe third is `p2`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider any superstring `T` that respects this order.\nWhen we read `T` from left to right, after the first occurrence of\n`p0` the string already contains `p0`.  \nThe next new characters that appear until the first occurrence of\n`p1` are exactly the minimal addition needed to embed `p1` after `p0`,\ni.e. the optimal merge of `p0` and `p1` (Lemma&nbsp;1).  \nThus the prefix of `T` up to the end of the first occurrence of `p1`\ncannot be shorter than `merge(p0 , p1)`.  \nApplying the same argument for `p2` shows that the whole `T` cannot be\nshorter than `merge( merge(p0 , p1) , p2 )`.  \nSince our construction obviously respects the order, it is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every optimal superstring `OPT` there exists a permutation `p`\nsuch that `OPT` is the optimal superstring for that permutation,\ni.e. `OPT = merge( merge(p0 , p1) , p2 )`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake the leftmost occurrence among the three given strings inside\n`OPT`. Call it `p0`.  \nAmong the remaining two, the one whose first occurrence starts earlier\nis `p1`, the last one is `p2`.  \nThus the order of first appearances in `OPT` is exactly the permutation\n`p = (p0 , p1 , p2)`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the shortest superstring respecting this order is\n`merge( merge(p0 , p1) , p2 )`.  \nBecause `OPT` respects the same order, it cannot be shorter, therefore\nit must be equal to that merge. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nAmong all superstrings of `a , b , c` the algorithm returns the one\nwith minimum length; if several have that length it returns the\nlexicographically smallest.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm enumerates all six permutations `p`.  \nFor each permutation it builds the unique optimal superstring for that\norder (Lemma&nbsp;2).  \nConsequently the set of strings examined by the algorithm contains **every**\noptimal superstring (Lemma&nbsp;3).  \nThe final selection chooses the shortest one, breaking ties by\nlexicographic order, exactly as required. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minimumString` returns the shortest possible string that contains `a`,\n`b` and `c` as substrings; if several strings have that length it returns\nthe lexicographically smallest among them.\n\n**Proof.**  \nDirectly from Lemma&nbsp;4. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.  Complexity Analysis  \n\n*`merge`* for two strings of length ≤ 100 runs in `O(100·100) = O(10⁴)` time\nand `O(1)` extra memory.\n\nWe call `merge` twice for each of the 6 permutations:\n\n```\nTime   : 6 · 2 · O(10⁴) = O(10⁵)          (well below 1 ms)\nMemory : O(1)   (only a few temporary strings)\n```\n\nBoth limits satisfy the constraints easily.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

For example, \"aa\", \"aba\", \"adbgad\", and, \"abab\" are semi-palindrome and \"a\", \"ab\", and, \"abca\" are not.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abcac\", k = 2\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We can divide s into substrings \"ab\" and \"cac\". The string \"cac\" is already a semi-palindrome. If we change \"ab\" to \"aa\", it becomes a semi-palindrome with d = 1.\nIt can be shown that there is no way to divide the string \"abcac\" into two semi-palindrome substrings. Therefore, the answer would be at least 1.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abcdef\", k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can divide it into substrings \"abc\" and \"def\". Each of the substrings \"abc\" and \"def\" requires one change to become a semi-palindrome, so we need 2 changes in total to make all substrings semi-palindrome.\nIt can be shown that we cannot divide the given string into two substrings in a way that it would require less than 2 changes.\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"aabbaa\", k = 3\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: We can divide it into substrings \"aa\", \"bb\" and \"aa\".\nThe strings \"aa\" and \"bb\" are already semi-palindromes.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible number of changes.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any substring `s[l … r]` (`len ≥ 2`) `cost[l][r]` equals the minimum number\nof character changes required to make it a semi‑palindrome.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll admissible values of `d` are examined.  \nFor a fixed `d` the algorithm counts, for every group, the mismatching\nsymmetric pairs – exactly the characters that must be changed to turn the\ngroup into a palindrome. Changing any of those characters is sufficient and\nnecessary, therefore the counted number is the optimal cost for this `d`.  \nTaking the minimum over all possible `d` yields the optimal cost among *all*\nways to obtain a semi‑palindrome. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor any `p (1 ≤ p ≤ k)` and any `i (0 ≤ i ≤ n)` `dp[p][i]` equals the minimum\ntotal changes needed to split the prefix `s[0 … i-1]` into `p` semi‑palindromic\nsubstrings.\n\n**Proof.** By induction over `p`.\n\n*Base `p = 1`*  \nThe only possible partition consists of the whole prefix `s[0 … i-1]`.  \nThe inner loop tries `t = 0` and sets `dp[1][i] = cost[0][i-1]`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 this is exactly the optimal cost.\n\n*Induction step*  \nAssume the statement true for `p‑1`.  \nConsider an optimal partition of the first `i` characters into `p` parts.\nLet the last part start at position `t` (`p‑1 ≤ t ≤ i‑2`).  \nThe first `t` characters are partitioned optimally into `p‑1` parts,\nhence cost `dp[p‑1][t]` (induction hypothesis).  \nThe last part costs `cost[t][i‑1]` (Lemma&nbsp;1).  \nTherefore the total optimal cost is at most\n`dp[p‑1][t] + cost[t][i‑1]` for some admissible `t`.  \nThe DP takes the minimum over **all** such `t`, consequently\n`dp[p][i]` cannot be larger than the optimum.\n\nConversely, any value produced by the DP corresponds to a concrete split:\nchoose the `t` that gave the minimum, use the optimal split for the prefix\n(`dp[p‑1][t]`) and the optimal transformation of the last part\n(`cost[t][i‑1]`). Hence the DP value is achievable, i.e. not smaller than the\noptimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nA partition into `k` substrings exists for every allowed input.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`k ≤ n/2`. Split the string into `k` blocks of length `2` and, if necessary,\nappend the remaining characters to the last block (its length becomes\n≥ 2). Every block of length `2` can be turned into a semi‑palindrome by at most\none change (make the two letters equal). Thus a feasible partition always\nexists. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`answer = dp[k][n]` returned by the algorithm is the minimum possible number\nof character changes required to partition `s` into exactly `k`\nsemi‑palindromic substrings.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2, `dp[k][n]` is the optimal cost among *all* partitions of the\nwhole string into `k` semi‑palindromes (if any).  \nLemma&nbsp;3 guarantees that at least one such partition exists, therefore\n`dp[k][n]` is finite and equals the global optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

At each step we increase it by `1` exactly when the\ncurrent element `nums[i]` equals `dom`. Hence after processing position\n`i` it counts precisely the occurrences of `dom` up to that position. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 3**  \nFor a fixed index `i` (`0 ≤ i < n‑1`) the two boolean tests\n\n```\npref * 2 > (i+1)                (A)\n(total - pref) * 2 > n-(i+1)    (B)\n```\n\nare true **iff** both sub‑arrays `nums[0 … i]` and `nums[i+1 … n-1]`\nhave `dom` as their dominant element.\n\n*Proof.*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2, `pref` is the frequency of `dom` in the left part,\nits length is `i+1`. Condition (A) is exactly the definition of\ndominance for the left part.  \nThe right part contains `total - pref` copies of `dom` and has length\n`n-(i+1)`. Condition (B) is the dominance definition for the right part.\nThus (A) and (B) hold precisely when `dom` dominates both sides. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 4**  \nIf the algorithm returns an index `i`, then `i` is a valid split.\n\n*Proof.*  \nThe algorithm returns only after both `left_ok` and `right_ok` are true.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 these are exactly the dominance conditions for the two\nsub‑arrays, therefore the split at `i` is valid. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 5**  \nIf a valid split exists, the algorithm returns the smallest such index.\n\n*Proof.*  \nThe loop scans indices in increasing order (`0,1,…,n-2`).  \nThe first index where both conditions become true is returned\n(Lemma&nbsp;4). Any earlier index failed at least one condition, so it\ncannot be a valid split. Hence the returned index is the minimum valid\none. ∎\n\n\n\n**Theorem**  \nThe algorithm returns  \n\n* the minimum index `i` that yields a valid split, or  \n* `-1` if no valid split exists.\n\n*Proof.*  \nIf a valid split exists, by Lemma&nbsp;5 the algorithm returns its\nminimum index.  \nIf the loop finishes without returning, no index satisfied both\nconditions, i.e. no split makes `dom` dominant on both sides\n(Lemma&nbsp;3).

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible total score.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any index `i`, after processing positions `0 … i` the variables  \n\n* `best_even` = max `dp[j]` over all `j ≤ i` with `nums[j]` even,  \n* `best_odd`  = max `dp[j]` over all `j ≤ i` with `nums[j]` odd,\n\nhold true.\n\n**Proof.** By induction over `i`.\n\n*Base (`i = 0`).*  \n`dp[0] = nums[0]`. The algorithm initializes exactly the corresponding\nbest variable with `dp[0]` and the other with `-inf`. The statement holds.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement true after processing up to `i‑1`.  \nWhen processing `i` we compute `dp[i]` (using the induction‑hypothesis\nvalues of `best_even`/`best_odd`). Afterwards we update the best variable\nmatching the parity of `nums[i]` with `max(old_best, dp[i])`.  \nThus the updated variable becomes the maximum `dp` among all indices\n≤ i of that parity, while the other variable stays unchanged and still\nrepresents the maximum among its parity. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor every index `i` the algorithm computes `dp[i]` equal to the\nmaximum total score of any valid walk that ends at `i`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider the two possible parities of `nums[i]`.\n\n*If `nums[i]` is even.*  \nAny optimal walk ending at `i` must come from some previous index `j < i`.\n\n* If `nums[j]` is even, the total score equals `dp[j] + nums[i]`\n  (no penalty). The best such `dp[j]` is exactly `best_even`\n  (Lemma&nbsp;1 before processing `i`).\n\n* If `nums[j]` is odd, the total score equals `dp[j] + nums[i] – x`.\n  The best such `dp[j]` is `best_odd – x`.\n\nThe optimal predecessor gives the larger of the two quantities,\nhence `dp[i] = nums[i] + max(best_even, best_odd – x)`,\nwhich is exactly what the algorithm uses.  \nThe odd case is symmetric. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every `i`, after processing it, `best_even` and `best_odd` are the\nmaximum scores of *any* walk that ends at an index ≤ i (respectively with\neven/odd `nums` value).\n\n**Proof.** Directly from Lemma&nbsp;1 and Lemma&nbsp;2: the best variables\nstore the maximum `dp` values, and each `dp` is the optimum for its\nending index. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the maximum possible total score achievable by any\nvalid walk starting at index 0.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAny valid walk ends at some index `k`. Its total score equals `dp[k]`\n(Lemma&nbsp;2). After the whole array is processed,\n`best_even` and `best_odd` contain the maximum `dp` over all even‑ and\nodd‑ending walks (Lemma&nbsp;3). Therefore `max(best_even, best_odd)` is\nthe maximum `dp[k]` over **all** possible ending indices `k`, i.e. the\noptimal total score. The algorithm returns exactly this value. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Both `a` and `b` belong to group `S_d`. By Lemma 2 the two largest numbers of `S_d` have sum ≥ `a+b`.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible number of groups.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nAfter processing the first `i` (sorted) limits, `cur` equals the largest\ninteger `g` such that we can build `g` groups of sizes `1 … g` using only\nthese `i` numbers.\n\n**Proof.** By induction over `i`.\n\n*Base (`i = 0`).* No numbers processed, `cur = 0`. Trivially the largest\nfeasible `g` is `0`.\n\n*Induction step.* Assume the statement holds after processing the first\n`i` limits, obtaining value `cur = g`. Consider the `(i+1)`‑st limit `x`.\n\n* If `x > g` the algorithm sets `cur = g+1`.  \n  Because `x` is larger than the number of already built groups,\n  we can put this number into the new group of size `g+1` (all its\n  `g+1` positions are distinct, and we have at least `g+1` numbers with\n  remaining usage ≥ 1: the `g` numbers used before plus this new one).\n  Hence `g+1` groups are feasible, and obviously we cannot obtain more than\n  `g+1` groups using only `i+1` numbers (each group needs a distinct number\n  for each of its positions). So the new `cur` is optimal.\n\n* If `x ≤ g` the algorithm leaves `cur = g`.  \n  Any group larger than `g` would need a new distinct number for each of\n  its `g+1` positions, but we already have only `g` numbers that can appear\n  at least once in the next group (all numbers processed so far have\n  remaining usage ≤ g). Therefore `g` remains the largest feasible value.\n\nThus the invariant holds for `i+1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nWhen the whole array has been processed, the returned `cur` equals the\nmaximum number of groups that can be built from *all* numbers.\n\n**Proof.** By Lemma&nbsp;1 after the last iteration `cur` is the largest\n`g` for which groups of sizes `1 … g` are feasible using *all* numbers.\nIf any solution with more than `g` groups existed, its group sizes would be\nstrictly increasing, hence at least `1,2,…,g+1`. That would contradict the\nmaximality of `g`. Therefore `g` is the overall optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`maxIncreasingGroups` returns the maximum possible number of groups that\nsatisfy the problem constraints.\n\n**Proof.** The algorithm returns the value `cur` after processing the whole\nsorted array. By Lemma&nbsp;2 this value equals the optimum, hence the\nalgorithm is correct. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the required count.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \n`dp(pos, prev, tight, started)` equals the number of ways to choose digits\nfor positions `pos … n‑1` such that\n\n* the already fixed prefix (`0 … pos‑1`) together with the chosen suffix\n  forms a **stepping number**,\n* the whole number has **no leading zero**,\n* it does **not exceed** the bound `S`,\n* the parameters `prev, tight, started` describe exactly the situation\n  after processing the prefix.\n\n**Proof.** By induction over `pos` (from `n` down to `0`).\n\n*Base (`pos = n`).*  \nNo more digits to place.  \nIf `started` is `True` we have built a positive integer → exactly one valid\ncompletion, otherwise we have only leading zeros → zero completions.\nThe returned value matches the definition.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement holds for `pos+1`.  \nAll possible digits `d` respecting the current `tight` flag are enumerated.\nThe three cases in the transition are exhaustive and mutually exclusive:\n\n1. `started = False` and `d = 0` – we stay in the “still no number” state,\n   the suffix count is given by the recursive call with unchanged `prev`\n   and `started = False`. By induction hypothesis this call counts exactly\n   the valid completions for this choice of `d`.\n\n2. `started = False` and `d ≠ 0` – we start the number with digit `d`.\n   Any non‑zero digit is allowed as first digit, therefore the recursive\n   call with `prev = d, started = True` counts precisely the completions\n   that keep the number stepping (the stepping condition will be checked\n   from the next position on). Induction hypothesis applies.\n\n3. `started = True` – the number already exists, the next digit must keep\n   the stepping property, i.e. `|d‑prev| = 1`. Only those `d` are considered,\n   and the recursive call receives the new `prev = d`. By induction\n   hypothesis the call counts exactly the valid completions for this `d`.\n\nSummation over all admissible `d` therefore yields the exact number of\nvalid completions for the current state. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \n`count_up_to(S)` (the value returned by the DP with initial state\n`pos = 0, prev = -1, tight = True, started = False`) equals the number of\nstepping numbers `x` with `1 ≤ x ≤ S`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe initial state represents the empty prefix, no previous digit,\nthe whole number must stay ≤ `S` (`tight = True`) and we have not started\nyet. By Lemma&nbsp;1 the DP value for this state counts exactly all\npossibilities to fill the whole string while satisfying the three required\nproperties (stepping, no leading zero, ≤ `S`). ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \n`dec_string(low)` returns the decimal representation of `low‑1`\n(if `low = \"0\"` it returns `\"0\"`).\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe routine performs the standard elementary school subtraction of `1`,\npropagating a borrow to the left as long as needed, and finally removes\npossible leading zeros. This is precisely the definition of the decimal\nrepresentation of `low‑1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nLet  \n\n```\nA = count_up_to(high)\nB = count_up_to(low‑1)          (low‑1 obtained by Lemma 3)\n```\n\nThen `A – B (mod MOD)` equals the number of stepping numbers `x` with\n`low ≤ x ≤ high`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`A` counts all stepping numbers `x` with `1 ≤ x ≤ high`.  \n`B` counts all stepping numbers `x` with `1 ≤ x ≤ low‑1`.  \nSubtracting removes exactly those numbers `< low`.  \nNumbers `≥ low` and `≤ high` remain, none are removed twice, none are added.\nTaking the result modulo `MOD` does not change the value in the integer\nrange `0 … MOD‑1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`Solution.countSteppingNumbers(low, high)` returns the number of stepping\nnumbers in the inclusive interval `[low, high]` modulo `10^9+7`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe method computes `lowMinusOne = dec_string(low)` (Lemma 3) and then\n\n```\nans = ( count_up_to(high) – count_up_to(lowMinusOne) ) mod MOD\n```\n\nBy Lemma 2 each `count_up_to` call yields the correct prefix count.\nLemma 4 shows that their difference is exactly the desired interval count.\nFinally the result is reduced modulo `MOD` as required. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

When is the whole task impossible ?\n\nEven if we have infinitely many seconds we can reset each index only\nonce (later resets do not change the final value).  \nIf we reset **all** `n` indices, the optimal times are\n`T, T‑1, … , T‑n+1`.  \nThe final sum then equals\n\n```\n Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} j * sorted_nums2_desc[j]                (6)\n```\n\nwhich is independent of `T`.  \nIf this minimum possible sum is larger than `x`, the answer is `-1`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the required minimum time.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed number of seconds `T`, resetting an index `i` at second `t`\nreduces the total sum by exactly `nums1[i] + t·nums2[i]`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFrom (2) the value without reset is `nums1[i] + T·nums2[i]`.  \nFrom (1) the value after a reset at `t` is `(T‑t)·nums2[i]`.  \nTheir difference is `nums1[i] + t·nums2[i]`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed `T` and a fixed set `S` of `k` indices, the maximum total\nreduction is obtained by assigning the times `T, T‑1, … , T‑k+1`\nto the indices of `S` in **non‑increasing** order of `nums2`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe reduction contributed by an index `i` with assigned time `t` is\n`nums1[i] + t·nums2[i]`.  \nThe constant part `Σ nums1[i]` is independent of the assignment.\nWe have to maximise `Σ t·nums2[i]` where the multiset `{t}` is\n`{T, T‑1, … , T‑k+1}`.\nBy the rearrangement inequality the sum of products of two sequences\nis maximal when both are sorted in the same order. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a fixed `T` the DP described in Section&nbsp;3 computes the\nmaximum possible reduction that can be achieved with at most `T` resets.\n\n**Proof.**  \nInduction over the processed elements.\n\n*Base.* Before processing any element `dp[0]=0` (no reduction) and\n`dp[p]=-∞` for `p>0` – correct.\n\n*Induction step.* Assume after processing the first `r` elements\n`dp[p]` equals the best reduction using exactly `p` of those `r`\nelements.  \nConsider element `e = (b,s)`.  \nIf we do **not** use `e`, the best reduction for `p` resets stays `dp[p]`.  \nIf we **use** `e` as the `(p+1)`‑st reset, the already used `p` resets\noccupy the largest `p` times (`T, T‑1, … , T‑p+1`).  \nConsequently `e` receives the next time `T‑p`.  \nThe reduction contributed by `e` is `b + (T‑p)·s` (Lemma&nbsp;1).  \nThus the total reduction becomes `dp[p] + b + (T‑p)·s`,\nexactly the transition used.\nTaking the maximum over the two possibilities yields the optimal value\nfor `p+1` resets after `r+1` elements. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor a given `T` the algorithm’s feasibility test returns *True*  \niff there exists a sequence of operations lasting `T` seconds whose\nfinal sum is ≤ `x`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If part.*  \nAssume the test returns *True*.  \nIf `total - x ≤ 0` the sum is already ≤ `x`.  \nOtherwise the DP found a reduction `R ≥ total - x`.  \nPerform the resets exactly as the DP constructed them:\nprocess the indices in the order used by the DP,\nreset the chosen index at the time prescribed by the DP\n(the DP’s construction respects the rule “one reset per second”).\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the total reduction equals `R`, therefore the final sum\nis `total - R ≤ x`.\n\n*Only‑if part.*  \nAssume there exists a valid schedule of length `T`.  \nLet `S` be the set of indices that are reset at least once,\n`k = |S| (k ≤ T)`.  \nTake the **last** reset time of each index; they are distinct seconds\n`t₁,…,t_k`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the total reduction of this schedule equals\n`Σ (nums1[i] + t_i·nums2[i])`.  \nReordering the indices by decreasing `nums2` can only increase this sum\n(Lemma&nbsp;2), therefore the optimal reduction for the same `k`\nis at least the reduction of the given schedule.\nThe DP enumerates all possibilities for every `k ≤ T`,\nhence its maximum `max_reduction` is at least the reduction of the\nschedule, i.e. `max_reduction ≥ total - x`.  \nConsequently the test returns *True*. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nIf the algorithm returns `-1` then no sequence of operations can ever\nmake the sum ≤ `x`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm returns `-1` only when the value (6)\n\n```\nmin_possible = Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} j * sorted(nums2,desc)[j]\n```\n\nis larger than `x`.  \nAfter any number of seconds we can reset each index at most once\n(the last reset determines the final value).  \nEven if we reset **all** indices, the optimal assignment of times is\nexactly the one that yields (6), therefore the final sum can never be\nsmaller than `min_possible`.  Since `min_possible > x`, reaching a sum\n≤ `x` is impossible. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 6  \nIf the answer exists, it is not larger than `n`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAfter `n` seconds we can reset every index once (one per second).\nUsing the optimal assignment of times (Lemma&nbsp;2) the final sum equals\n(6), which is ≤ `x` by Lemma&nbsp;5’s negation.  Hence `n` seconds are\nalways sufficient. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns  \n\n* `-1` iff it is impossible to obtain a sum ≤ `x`;\n* otherwise the smallest integer `T` such that the sum can be ≤ `x`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Impossibility* follows from Lemma&nbsp;5.\n\nAssume the answer exists.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;6 the answer lies in `[0, n]`.  \nThe binary search checks feasibility for any `T` in this interval.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the feasibility test is correct.\nBinary search on a monotone predicate (once feasible, all larger `T`\nare feasible) returns the smallest feasible `T`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.

With `x = I.start-1` we count exactly those intervals whose end\n`≤ I.start-1`, i.e. end `< I.start`. Their indices are `0 … p-1`. No later interval\nsatisfies the condition, otherwise its end would also be `≤ I.start-1` and would\nhave been counted. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf an optimal solution contains interval `I`, then the rest of the solution is\nan optimal solution for the sub‑problem consisting of intervals that end before\n`I` starts.\n\n**Proof.** Suppose an optimal solution `S` contains `I`. Remove `I` from `S`,\nobtaining set `S'`. All intervals in `S'` end before `I` starts (otherwise they\nwould overlap). If `S'` were not optimal for that sub‑problem, we could replace it\nby a better set `S''` and together with `I` obtain a solution better than `S`,\ncontradiction. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`dp[m]` returned by the algorithm equals the maximum total gold obtainable\nunder the given constraints.\n\n**Proof.** By Lemma&nbsp;1, `dp[m]` is the optimum among all subsets of the whole\nsorted list, i.e. among all possible collections of non‑overlapping offers.\nThus it is exactly the desired maximum profit. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the exact number of beautiful integers\nin `[low, high]`.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any prefix processed by `dfs(pos, diff, rem, started, tight)`  \n`diff` equals **evenCnt – oddCnt** of the already fixed (non‑leading‑zero)\ndigits, and `rem` equals the value of that prefix modulo `k`.\n\n**Proof.** By induction over `pos`.\n\n*Base (`pos = 0`).* No digit fixed yet, `diff = 0`, `rem = 0`. Both statements\nhold.\n\n*Induction step.* Assume the lemma true for state `(pos, …)`.  \nWhen we append a digit `d`:\n\n* If `started` is still `False` and `d = 0`, the prefix does not change,\n  `diff` and `rem` stay unchanged – the lemma stays true.\n* Otherwise the digit belongs to the number.\n  * If `d` is even, `diff` is increased by `1`; if odd, decreased by `1`.\n    This exactly updates `evenCnt – oddCnt`.\n  * `rem` becomes `(old_rem * 10 + d) mod k`, which is the definition of the\n    remainder of the longer prefix.\n\nThus the lemma holds for `pos+1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nWhen `pos == len(digits)` the DP returns `1` **iff** the constructed integer\nsatisfies both conditions (1) and (2) of a beautiful number.\n\n**Proof.** At this moment the whole number is fixed.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 `diff` equals `evenCnt – oddCnt` and `rem` equals the number\nmodulo `k`.  \nThe DP returns `1` exactly when `started` is `True` (the number is non‑empty),\n`diff == 0` (condition 1) and `rem == 0` (condition 2). ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \n`count(X)` equals the number of beautiful integers `n` with `0 ≤ n ≤ X`.\n\n**Proof.** `count` runs the DP over all digit strings that are ≤ the decimal\nrepresentation of `X`.  \n*Every* integer `n` with `0 ≤ n ≤ X` corresponds to exactly one path in the\nDP (its digit sequence, padded with leading zeros to the length of `X`).  \nConversely, every path respects the `tight` constraint, therefore its numeric\nvalue does not exceed `X`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 a path contributes `1` precisely when the represented integer\nis beautiful. Summation over all paths yields the desired count. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \n`count(high) - count(low-1)` equals the number of beautiful integers in the\nclosed interval `[low, high]`.\n\n**Proof.** By Lemma&nbsp;3, `count(high)` counts all beautiful numbers `≤ high`,\nand `count(low-1)` counts all beautiful numbers `< low`. Their difference\nremoves the latter, leaving exactly those with `low ≤ n ≤ high`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`numberOfBeautifulIntegers(low, high, k)` returns the correct answer.\n\n**Proof.** The method computes `count(high) - count(low-1)`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 this value is precisely the amount of beautiful integers in\nthe required interval, which is the definition of the problem’s answer. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Reformulation\n\n*We have a multiset `M` of powers of two.  \nIn one operation we may replace one `2^k (k>0)` by two `2^{k-1}`.  \nHow many operations are necessary (minimum) so that `M` contains a subset whose\nsum equals `target`?*  \n\nIf it is impossible we return `-1`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.   Observations\n\n* The binary representation of `target` tells us which powers of two we **must**\n  have at least once.\n  Example: `target = 13 = 1101₂` → we need one `2^0`, one `2^2`, one `2^3`.\n\n* Having *more* copies of a power is never harmful – we can simply ignore the\n  surplus.\n\n* Two copies of `2^k` can be regarded as one copy of `2^{k+1}`.\n  This “merge” costs **no operation** (we are only interested in existence of a\n  subset, not in how we would actually build the larger number).  \n  Consequently we may freely **carry** `cnt[k] // 2` pieces to the next level.\n\n* If at some bit `i` we need a piece `2^i` but own none, we have to **split**\n  a larger piece.  \n  Splitting a `2^j` (`j>i`) down to `2^i` needs exactly `j‑i` operations:\n  each split reduces the exponent by one.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Greedy processing from low to high bits  \n\nWe keep an array `cnt[0 … 60]` – `cnt[p]` = how many `2^p` we currently have.\n(60 is safe because the biggest possible power after many carries is\n`2^30 * 2 = 2^31`.)\n\nWe walk through the bits `i = 0 … 60`\n\n```\nneed = 1   if the i‑th bit of target is 1\nneed = 0   otherwise\n```\n\n*If we already have enough pieces* (`cnt[i] >= need`) we simply use them\n(`cnt[i] -= need`).\n\n*Otherwise* we have to create a piece by splitting a larger one:\n\n```\nmissing = need - cnt[i]          # 1 in our case, because need is 0/1\nfind the smallest j > i with cnt[j] > 0\nif none exists → impossible → return -1\nfor k = j, j-1, …, i+1:\n        cnt[k]   -= 1            # take one piece 2^k\n        cnt[k-1] += 2            # replace it by two halves\n        answer   += 1            # one operation per split\n# after the loop cnt[i] increased by 2, enough for the missing piece\ncnt[i] -= need\n```\n\nAfter satisfying the current bit we **carry** the surplus to the next level:\n\n```\ncnt[i+1] += cnt[i] // 2\n```\n\nThe greedy choice is optimal:\n\n*We always split the *nearest* larger piece (smallest `j`).  \nAny solution that splits a piece farther away would need at least as many\noperations, because each extra level adds one more split.*\n\nProcessing bits from low to high guarantees that all pieces we create for a\ncertain bit are still available for higher bits (through the carry).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible number of operations\nor `-1` when impossible.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nWhen the algorithm finishes processing bit `i`, the multiset represented by\n`cnt[·]` can realise all bits `0 … i` of `target`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nInduction over `i`.\n\n*Base `i = -1`* (nothing processed) – trivially true.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement holds after bit `i-1`.  \nWhen processing bit `i` the algorithm distinguishes two cases.\n\n1. `cnt[i] ≥ need`.  \n   It uses `need` copies of `2^i` and leaves the rest untouched.\n   Hence the bits `0 … i` are satisfied.\n\n2. `cnt[i] < need`.  \n   The algorithm finds the smallest `j>i` with `cnt[j]>0` and splits it\n   repeatedly until a copy of `2^i` appears.  \n   Each split replaces one `2^k` by two `2^{k-1}` – the total sum of the\n   multiset does **not** change, only the distribution of powers.\n   After `j-i` splits we own at least one `2^i`, use it for the missing bit,\n   and keep the rest (including the newly created lower pieces).  \n   Therefore bits `0 … i` are satisfied.\n\nIn both cases after the possible carry `cnt[i+1] += cnt[i] // 2` the invariant\nremains true for the next iteration. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf the algorithm declares impossibility (`-1`), no sequence of operations can\nproduce a subsequence summing to `target`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm returns `-1` only when it needs a piece `2^i` (because the\n`i`‑th bit of `target` is `1`) and there is **no** piece of any larger power\npresent in the current multiset.  \nAll further operations are splits, which can only create **smaller** powers.\nThus it is impossible to ever obtain a `2^i`. Consequently `target` cannot be\nreached. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nWhenever the algorithm splits a piece `2^j` (`j>i`) to obtain a needed\n`2^i`, any feasible solution must perform at least `j-i` split operations\nin total (maybe on different pieces).\n\n**Proof.**  \nA split reduces the exponent by exactly one. To turn any collection of\nnumbers that are all `≤ 2^{j-1}` into a `2^i` we need at least `j-i` reductions,\nbecause the exponent must decrease from `j` to `i`.  \nThus any solution that creates a `2^i` from numbers not larger than `2^{j-1}`\nneeds at least `j-i` splits. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe number of operations counted by the algorithm is **minimal**.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider the moment the algorithm processes bit `i` and needs a piece `2^i`\nbut has none. Let `j` be the smallest exponent with `cnt[j] > 0`.  \nThe algorithm performs exactly `j-i` splits (Lemma 3 shows that any solution\nmust spend at least `j-i` splits to obtain a `2^i` from numbers not larger than\n`2^{j-1}`).  \n\nBecause `j` is the *nearest* larger exponent, any other solution would have to\nsplit a piece of exponent `≥ j`, which needs **≥ j‑i** splits as well.\nHence the algorithm is optimal for this bit.\n\nProcessing bits from low to high never creates a situation where a later\nchoice could have been done cheaper earlier (the carry operation is free).\nSumming the optimal contributions of all bits yields a globally optimal\ntotal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minOperations` returns  \n\n* the minimum possible number of operations that makes `target` achievable as\n  a subsequence sum, or  \n* `-1` if it is impossible.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf the algorithm returns `-1`, Lemma 2 guarantees impossibility.  \nOtherwise it finishes all bits. By Lemma 1 the final multiset contains a\nsubset summing to `target`. Lemma 4 proves that the counted operations are\nminimal among all possible sequences of operations. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.   Complexity Analysis  \n\n*`MAX = 60`* (constant)\n\n* building the frequency array: `O(n)`  \n* main loop over bits `0 … MAX`: each split walks down at most `MAX` levels,\n  but every split reduces the total exponent sum, therefore the total number\n  of performed inner‑loop iterations is bounded by the answer ≤ `30·n`.  \n  In any case it is `O(MAX²)` = `O(1)`.\n\nOverall time   `O(n)`  \nMemory usage   `O(MAX)` = `O(1)`.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible value of `f(x)`.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor every vertex `v` and every `p (0 ≤ p < LOG)` the tables satisfy  \n\n*`up[v][p]`* is the vertex reached from `v` after exactly `2^p` steps, and  \n\n*`sum[v][p]`* equals the sum of the ids of all vertices visited **after** the\nfirst step and **up to** the `2^p`‑th step (the start vertex `v` itself is not\nincluded).\n\n**Proof.** By induction over `p`.\n\n*Base `p = 0`* : by definition `up[v][0] = receiver[v]` – one step,\n`sum[v][0] = receiver[v]` – the only visited vertex, property holds.\n\n*Induction step* : assume the statement true for `p‑1`.  \nTwo blocks of length `2^{p‑1}` are concatenated.\n\n* the vertex after the first block is `up[v][p‑1]`\n* after the second block we are at `up[ up[v][p‑1] ][p‑1]`,\n  which is exactly `up[v][p]` by the construction.\n* the visited ids are the union of the ids of the first block\n  (`sum[v][p‑1]`) and the ids of the second block\n  (`sum[ up[v][p‑1] ][p‑1]`). Their sum is `sum[v][p]`.\n\nThus the claim holds for `p`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed start vertex `x` the algorithm described in section&nbsp;2 returns\n`f(x)`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm processes the binary representation of `k` from the most\nsignificant bit to the least.\nWhenever the current remaining steps `rem` contain a `1` at position `p`,\nthe algorithm adds `sum[cur][p]` to the answer and moves `cur` to\n`up[cur][p]`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 `sum[cur][p]` is exactly the sum of the ids visited during the\nnext `2^p` steps, and `up[cur][p]` is the vertex where we stand after those\nsteps. Therefore after handling all set bits we have added the ids of **all**\n`k` passes, and we started with `total = x`. Consequently `total = f(x)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every vertex `x` the algorithm computes `f(x)` in `O(LOG)` time.\n\n**Proof.** Directly from Lemma&nbsp;2 and the loop that iterates over at most\n`LOG` bits. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns  \n\n```\nmax_{0 ≤ x < n} f(x)\n```\n\nthe maximum possible value of the required function.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*Construction phase* builds correct tables (Lemma&nbsp;1).  \n*Evaluation phase* iterates over all `x` (there are `n` of them) and, by\nLemma&nbsp;2, obtains the exact value `f(x)` for each of them in `O(LOG)` time\n(Lemma&nbsp;3).  \nThe algorithm keeps the largest of those values, therefore the final answer\nis the maximum of `f(x)` over all starting players. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible total cost.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any two mismatching positions `i < j` the cheapest way to make them\nequal (while leaving all other positions unchanged) costs  \n`pairCost(i , j) = min(x , j-i)`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*Global operation* flips exactly `i` and `j` – cost `x`.  \n*Adjacent operations* can be applied consecutively on the segment\n`[i , j]`. Each operation flips a pair of neighbours, therefore after\n`j-i` such operations both `i` and `j` are flipped once and every inner\nposition is flipped twice (back to its original value). The total cost\nis `j-i`. No other sequence can be cheaper because any operation flips\nexactly two bits, thus at least one operation is necessary and each\noperation costs at least `1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed interval `l … r` (even length) `dp[l][r]` equals the minimum\ncost of a perfect matching that uses **only** vertices inside this\ninterval.\n\n**Proof.** By induction over the length of the interval.\n\n*Base* – length `0` (`l > r`): empty matching, cost `0`.  \nLength `2` (`r = l+1`): the only possible matching pairs `l` with `r`,\ncost `w(l,r)`. The recurrence gives exactly this value.\n\n*Induction step* – assume the statement true for all shorter even\nintervals.  \nConsider an optimal matching `M` of interval `l … r`.\n\n*Case 1* – `l` is matched with `r`.  \nRemoving this pair leaves a perfect matching of the inner interval\n`l+1 … r-1`. By induction its optimal cost is `dp[l+1][r-1]`. Adding the\npair contributes `w(l,r)`. Hence the total cost of `M` is at least\n`dp[l+1][r-1] + w(l,r)`. The recurrence also contains this candidate,\nso `dp[l][r]` is ≤ the optimum.\n\n*Case 2* – `l` is matched with some `p` (`l < p < r`).  \nBecause the matching is perfect, the vertices `l … p` are matched only\namong themselves, and the vertices `p+1 … r` are matched only among\nthemselves. Both sub‑matchings are optimal for their intervals,\notherwise we could replace them by cheaper ones and obtain a cheaper\noverall matching – contradiction to optimality of `M`.  \nThus the cost of `M` equals `dp[l][p] + dp[p+1][r]`. The recurrence\nexamines all such split points `p` (only those with even sized left\npart are possible) and therefore `dp[l][r]` is ≤ the optimum.\n\nSince `dp[l][r]` is never larger than the optimum (by construction) and\nnever smaller (every candidate corresponds to a feasible matching),\nthey are equal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \n`dp[0][k-1]` equals the minimum total cost to transform `s1` into `s2`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll mismatching positions are exactly the vertices `0 … k-1`.  \nAny sequence of allowed operations can be viewed as a set of pairs of\nindices that are flipped together; each index appears in exactly one\npair because after it is fixed it must never be flipped again.\nThus the sequence corresponds to a perfect matching of the vertices,\nand its total cost is the sum of the pair costs `w(i,j)`.  \nConversely, any perfect matching can be realised by performing for each\npair either the global operation (cost `x`) or the chain of adjacent\noperations (cost `j-i`), whichever is cheaper – Lemma&nbsp;1 guarantees\nthat this realises exactly the weight `w(i,j)`.  \nTherefore the optimal transformation cost equals the minimum weight\nperfect matching cost, which by Lemma&nbsp;2 is `dp[0][k-1]`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf `x = 1` the algorithm returns `k/2`, which is optimal.\n\n**Proof.** With `x = 1` any pair can be fixed for cost `1`.  \nAny feasible transformation must pair all `k` mismatches, thus needs at\nleast `k/2` operations, each costing at least `1`. Hence `k/2` is a lower\nbound and is achievable by repeatedly using the global operation. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe function `minOperations` returns  \n\n* `-1` iff it is impossible to make the strings equal,\n* otherwise the minimum possible total cost.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If `k` is odd* – no perfect matching exists, transformation impossible,\nthe algorithm returns `-1`.\n\n*If `k` is even* –  \n\n* when `x = 1` Lemma&nbsp;4 shows optimality,\n* when `x > 1` Lemma&nbsp;3 shows that `dp[0][k-1]` (computed by the\n  algorithm) equals the optimal cost.\n\nThus in all cases the returned value is exactly the required answer. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.

After a right rotation by `k`,\nits new index is `(d+1 + k) % n = (d+1 + n - (d+1)) % n = 0`.  \nAll other elements keep their relative order because the original array was\nstrictly increasing apart from the single drop.

Since `i ≤ i*`, `n - i - 2 ≥ n - i* - 2`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nUsing the pair `i* , j*` found by the algorithm for pattern `ab`\nproduces a feasible solution with exactly `n - i* - 2` deletions.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy construction `i* < j*`, `num[i*]=a`, `num[j*]=b`.  \nDelete all digits after `j*` and all digits between `i*` and `j*`.\nThe remaining number ends with `ab`, therefore is divisible by 25.\nThe number of deletions is precisely `n - i* - 2`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor each pattern `ab` the algorithm computes the minimum possible deletions\namong all solutions that end with `ab`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFrom Lemma&nbsp;2 the algorithm achieves `n - i* - 2` deletions.\nFrom Lemma&nbsp;1 no solution ending with `ab` can use fewer deletions.\nHence the algorithm’s value is optimal for this pattern. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf the algorithm returns `n‑1`, there exists a solution that keeps a single\nzero and deletes all other digits.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm only sets `answer = n‑1` when a character `'0'` occurs in\n`num`. Keeping that digit and deleting the remaining `n‑1` digits yields the\nnumber `0`, which is divisible by 25. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nIf the algorithm returns `n`, deleting all digits (resulting in `0`) is the\nonly possible way to obtain a number divisible by 25.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`answer = n` only when none of the four patterns can be formed\n(Lemma 3 gives no smaller value) **and** there is no `'0'` in the string\n(Lemma 4 does not apply).  \nThus any non‑empty subsequence of `num` cannot end with a valid pattern,\nso it is not divisible by 25.

**iff** every prime appears an even number of times in the\nproduct, i.e. for every prime `p`\n\n```\ne_i + f_i   is even\n```\n\nOnly the *parity* of the exponents matters.  \nDefine the **square‑free kernel** of a number `x`\n\n```\nkernel(x) = product of all primes whose exponent in x is odd\n```\n\n(If a prime occurs an even number of times it disappears, otherwise it stays once.)\n\n*Lemma*  \n`a·b` is a perfect square  ⇔  `kernel(a) == kernel(b)`.\n\n*Proof*  \n\n```\na = kernel(a) * (some square)\nb = kernel(b) * (some square)\na·b = kernel(a)·kernel(b) * (square)\n```\n\n`kernel(a)·kernel(b)` is square‑free (every prime appears at most once).  \nA square‑free number is a perfect square only when it equals `1`.  \nThus `a·b` is a square ⇔ `kernel(a)·kernel(b) = 1` ⇔ `kernel(a)=kernel(b)`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Reduction of the problem\nAll numbers inside a *complete* subset must have the same kernel.\nConversely, any set of numbers that share the same kernel is complete,\nbecause every pair satisfies the condition of the lemma.\n\nTherefore the task becomes:\n\n*Group the array by `kernel(num)`.  \nFor each group compute the sum of its elements.  \nThe answer is the maximum group sum (a single element is a group of size 1).*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Computing the kernel\n\n`num ≤ 10⁹`, its prime factors are ≤ √10⁹ ≈ 31623.  \nWe sieve all primes up to 31623 (≈3400 primes) once.\nFor each number we trial‑divide by those primes, counting the exponent modulo 2.\nIf the exponent is odd we multiply the prime into the kernel.\nAfter the loop, if a remainder `> 1` is left, it is a prime with exponent 1,\nso it also belongs to the kernel.\n\nThe kernel fits into a 64‑bit integer ( ≤ 10⁹ ).\n\nComplexity per number: `O(number of prime factors)`, worst case `O(√num / log √num)`.  \nWith `n ≤ 10⁴` the total work is well below one second.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Algorithm\n```\nsieve primes up to

value in group_sum\nreturn answer\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible element‑sum of a\ncomplete subset.\n\n---\n\n#### Lemma 1  \nFor any two numbers `a , b` in the input, `a·b` is a perfect square  \niff `kernel(a) = kernel(b)`.\n\n*Proof* – already shown above. ∎\n\n\n\n#### Lemma 2  \nAll numbers belonging to the same dictionary key `k` (i.e. having the same\nkernel) form a complete subset.\n\n*Proof*  \nTake any two numbers `a , b` from that group. By construction\n`kernel(a)=kernel(b)=k`. By Lemma&nbsp;1 their product is a perfect square.\nSince the condition holds for every pair, the whole group is complete. ∎\n\n\n\n#### Lemma 3  \nAny complete subset `S` of indices is contained in a single group of the\ndictionary.\n\n*Proof*  \nAssume `S` contains two numbers `a , b` with different kernels.\nThen `kernel(a) ≠ kernel(b)`. By Lemma&nbsp;1 `a·b` is **not** a perfect square,\ncontradicting the completeness of `S`. Hence all elements of `S` share the\nsame kernel and belong to the same group. ∎\n\n\n\n#### Lemma 4  \nFor each kernel `k` the algorithm stores in `group_sum[k]` exactly the sum of\nall numbers whose kernel equals `k`.\n\n*Proof*  \nThe loop processes every input number once, computes its kernel `k`,\nand adds the number to `group_sum[k]`. No other numbers are added to that entry,\nand no number with kernel `k` is missed. ∎\n\n\n\n#### Theorem  \nThe value returned by the algorithm equals the maximum element‑sum of any\ncomplete subset of the given array.\n\n*Proof*  \n\n*Upper bound.*  \nTake any complete subset `S`. By Lemma&nbsp;3 all its elements have a common\nkernel `k`. By Lemma&nbsp;4 the sum of all numbers with kernel `k` is\n`group_sum[k]`, which is **at least** the sum of `S`. Therefore the maximum\nover all `group_sum` values is an upper bound for any complete subset sum.\n\n*Achievability.*  \nFor each kernel `k`, Lemma&nbsp;2 shows that the whole group of numbers with\nkernel `k` is itself a complete subset, whose sum is exactly `group_sum[k]`.\nConsequently the maximum dictionary entry is attainable.\n\nSince the algorithm returns this maximum entry, it is both an upper bound\nand attainable, i.e. it is the optimal answer. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Complexity Analysis\n\n* Let `P` be the number of primes ≤ 31623 (`P ≈ 3400`).\n\n*Pre‑processing* – sieve: `O(31623 log log 31623)` ≈ negligible.\n\n*Processing each number* – trial division by at most `P` primes, but stops early\nwhen the current prime squared exceeds the remaining value.\nOverall time ≤ `O(n * √max(nums) / log √max(nums))`  \n≈ `O(10⁴ * 3400)` ≈ `3.4·10⁷` elementary operations.\n\n*Space* – list of primes (`≈3400` integers) + dictionary with at most `n`\nentries: `O(n + P)`.\n\nBoth limits satisfy the constraints.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # ---------- sieve primes up to 31623 ----------\n        LIMIT = int(math.isqrt(10**9)) + 1          # 31623\n        is_prime = [True] * (LIMIT + 1)\n        is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False\n        primes = []\n        for i in range(2, LIMIT + 1):\n            if is_prime[i]:\n                primes.append(i)\n                step = i\n                start = i * i\n                if start > LIMIT:\n                    continue\n                for j in range(start, LIMIT + 1, step):\n                    is_prime[j] = False\n\n        # ---------- helper: compute square‑free kernel ----------\n        def kernel(x: int) -> int:\n            res = 1\n            tmp = x\n            for p in primes:\n                if p * p > tmp:\n                    break\n                cnt = 0\n                while tmp % p == 0:\n                    tmp //= p\n                    cnt ^= 1          # keep only parity\n                if cnt:               # odd exponent\n                    res *= p\n            if tmp > 1:               # remaining prime factor\n                res *= tmp\n            return res\n\n        # ---------- group sums ----------\n        group_sum = defaultdict(int)\n        for v in nums:\n            k = kernel(v)\n            group_sum[k] += v\n\n        # ---------- answer ----------\n        return max(group_sum.values())\n```\n\nThe program follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms\nto the required function signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: invalid syntax.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the required maximum number of subarrays.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nIf the AND of the whole array `ALL` is positive, any split of the array has\ntotal score `≥ ALL`, and the split consisting of the whole array has total\nscore exactly `ALL`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFor any subarray `S`, `score(S) = AND of elements of S`.  \nSince `ALL` is the AND of *all* elements, adding more elements can only clear\nbits, never set new ones, therefore `score(S) ≥ ALL`.  \nIf the array is taken as a single subarray, its score equals `ALL`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nWhen `ALL = 0`, any split whose total score is `0` must consist only of\nsubarrays whose individual score is `0`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll scores are non‑negative. If any part had a positive score, the sum would be\npositive, contradicting total score `0`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3 (Greedy optimality)  \nAssume `ALL = 0`. Let `p` be the smallest index such that the AND of\n`nums[0 … p]` equals `0`.  \nThere exists an optimal (maximum‑size) zero‑score partition whose first part\nends exactly at `p`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake any optimal partition `P`. Its first part must have AND `0` (Lemma&nbsp;2).\nIf it ends after `p`, replace it by the shorter prefix `nums[0 … p]`\n(which also has AND `0`). The remaining suffix of `P` still covers the rest of\nthe array, therefore we obtain another valid partition with the same number of\nparts and first part ending at `p`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe greedy algorithm (cut as soon as the running AND becomes `0`) produces a\npartition with the maximum possible number of zero‑AND subarrays.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWe prove by induction on the number of parts.\n\n*Base.* The first cut of the greedy algorithm is at the smallest index `p`\nwith prefix AND `0`. By Lemma&nbsp;3 there exists an optimal partition whose\nfirst part also ends at `p`. Hence after the first cut the greedy algorithm\nhas not used more elements than any optimal solution.\n\n*Induction step.* After the first cut the algorithm restarts on the suffix\nstarting at `p+1`. The situation is identical to the original one (the whole\narray AND of the suffix is still `0`, otherwise the total AND of the whole\narray would be non‑zero). By the induction hypothesis the greedy algorithm\nproduces a maximal number of parts on this suffix. Adding the first part,\nthe whole greedy partition is maximal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nIf `ALL = 0` the algorithm returns exactly the number of parts in the greedy\npartition described in Lemma&nbsp;4.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe variable `cur` holds the AND of the current unfinished part.\nWhenever `cur` becomes `0` the algorithm increments `ans` and resets `cur`,\nwhich is precisely the greedy cutting rule. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the maximum possible number of subarrays among all\nsplits whose total score is minimal.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Case 1:* `ALL > 0`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the minimal total score is `ALL` and the only split achieving it\nis the whole array, therefore the answer is `1`. The algorithm returns `1`.\n\n*Case 2:* `ALL = 0`.  \nThe minimal total score is `0`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 any optimal split must consist solely of zero‑score subarrays.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the greedy partition has the largest possible number of such\nsubarrays, and by Lemma&nbsp;5 the algorithm outputs exactly its size.\nHence the algorithm returns the required maximum number of subarrays.\n\nBoth cases cover all inputs, completing the proof. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Observations  \n\n* An element can be used in at most one pair (once it is deleted it is gone).\n* If we pair a small element with the *earliest* possible larger element,\n  we keep the later larger elements available for the remaining small ones.\n  This greedy choice never hurts the total number of pairs.\n* Because the array is sorted, all candidates for the “larger” partner of a\n  given element lie to its right.\n\nThus the task reduces to **maximising the number of disjoint pairs\n`(small, large)` with `small < large` and `small` positioned left of `large`.**\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.

Starting `j` at the middle guarantees that there\nare enough elements on the right side to serve as possible large partners.\nIf a pair is possible, the algorithm will find it; otherwise `j` moves forward\nlooking for a larger value.\n\nWhen the loop finishes, `pairs` is the maximum number of deletable pairs.\nEach pair removes two elements, therefore the minimal possible length is  \n\n```\nanswer = n - 2 * pairs\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.  Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimal possible length.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nDuring the algorithm, when `nums[i] < nums[j]` holds, pairing `i` with `j`\ndoes not decrease the maximum achievable number of pairs.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll elements left of `i` are already paired (or there are none).  \nAll elements between `i` and `j` are `≥ nums[i]` (sorted) and `≤ nums[j]`.  \nBecause `nums[i] < nums[j]`, any optimal solution can replace the partner of\n`i` (if it exists) by `j` without breaking the strict‑inequality condition,\nand the former partner of `i` (if it was a larger element) can later be used\nas the large partner of some other still‑unpaired small element.\nThus using the earliest possible larger element never harms optimality. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nWhen the algorithm finishes, no further pair `(p,q)` with `p < q` and\n`nums[p] < nums[q]` exists among the remaining (unpaired) elements.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe loop stops only when either `i` reached `n//2` (no more small candidates)\nor `j` reached `n` (no more large candidates).  \nIf `i < n//2` and `j == n`, every remaining large element has been examined\nand was **not** larger than the current `nums[i]`; otherwise the loop would\nhave paired them. Hence no larger element exists to the right of any remaining\nsmall element. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe number `pairs` produced by the algorithm is maximal.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAssume there exists an optimal solution with more than `pairs` pairs.\nConsider the first position where this optimal solution differs from the\nalgorithm’s greedy choices. Let the algorithm pair `(i, j)` (the earliest\npossible large element) while the optimal solution pairs `i` with some\n`j' > j`. Because `nums[i] < nums[j] ≤ nums[j']`, we can replace `j'` by `j`\nin the optimal solution (Lemma&nbsp;1) and keep the rest of the pairs unchanged.\nThus we obtain another optimal solution that agrees with the algorithm for one\nmore pair – contradicting the choice of the first differing position.\nBy induction the greedy construction matches an optimal solution for all\npairs, therefore `pairs` is maximal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`answer = n - 2 * pairs` returned by the algorithm equals the minimum possible\nlength of the array after any sequence of allowed operations.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*Upper bound*: The algorithm actually performs `pairs` deletions, leaving exactly\n`n - 2 * pairs` elements, so the minimal length cannot be larger than `answer`.\n\n*Lower bound*: By Lemma&nbsp;3, no sequence of operations can delete more than\n`pairs` pairs, i.e. cannot remove more than `2 * pairs` elements.\nConsequently at least `n - 2 * pairs` elements must stay, so the minimal length\ncannot be smaller than `answer`.\n\nBoth bounds coincide, therefore `answer` is the true minimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Decreasing `b` by one makes the remainder\n`c-3(b-1) = (c-3b)+3`, which flips parity (odd → even).  \nThus the first `b` that makes the remainder even is exactly the largest `b`\nthat allows an integer `a`. No larger `b` can work because the initial `b`\nwas already the greatest possible. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a count `c` the algorithm returns the minimum possible number of operations\nor reports impossibility correctly.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If the algorithm reports impossibility*: it means the loop decreased `b`\nuntil `b < 0`. That implies for every `b ≥ 0` the remainder `c-3b` is odd,\nhence never divisible by 2, so no integer `a` exists. Therefore the equation\nhas no solution – the count truly cannot be cleared.\n\n*If the algorithm returns a number*: by Lemma&nbsp;2 the obtained `b` is the\nlargest feasible one, and the corresponding `a` is non‑negative.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 this pair `(a,b)` yields the smallest possible `a+b`.\nThus the returned value is the minimum number of operations for this `c`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe total number of operations returned by the algorithm is minimal among all\nways to empty the whole array (when possible).\n\n**Proof.**  \nOperations on different values are independent – an operation always removes\nelements of a single value. Consequently any complete sequence of deletions can\nbe partitioned per value, and the number of operations used for a particular\nvalue equals the number of groups chosen for its count.  \nFor each value the algorithm uses the minimal possible number of groups\n(Lemma&nbsp;3). Summing these minima over all values yields a total that cannot\nbe improved by any other global strategy. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minOperations` returns  \n\n* the minimum possible number of operations required to delete all elements,\n  or  \n* `-1` if it is impossible.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm processes every distinct value.\n\n*If any value is impossible* (Lemma&nbsp;3) the whole array cannot be emptied,\nso the algorithm returns `-1`, which is correct.\n\n*Otherwise* each value contributes its minimal number of operations\n(Lemma&nbsp;3).

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns exactly the number of ways to select\na group that makes every student happy.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed `k` the only possible selection that can make all students\nhappy is  \n`S(k) = { i | nums[i] < k }`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake any student `i`.\n\n* If `nums[i] < k` then the condition `k > nums[i]` holds, therefore the\n  student must be selected, otherwise he would need `k < nums[i]`,\n  which is false.\n* If `nums[i] > k` then `k < nums[i]` holds, therefore the student must\n  be **not** selected, otherwise he would need `k > nums[i]`, false.\n* If `nums[i] = k` no condition can be satisfied, thus such a `k` is\n  impossible.\n\nConsequently every feasible selection for this `k` must contain exactly\nthe indices with `nums[i] < k`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nA value `k` is feasible (there exists a selection making everybody happy)\niff  \n\n* `cntLess(k) = k` and\n* no element of `nums` equals `k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If* the two conditions hold, take the forced set `S(k)` from Lemma&nbsp;1.\nIts size is `cntLess(k) = k`, therefore it indeed contains `k` students.\nAll students satisfy the required inequality, so the selection works.\n\n*Only‑if*: assume a feasible selection exists for `k`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the selection must be exactly `S(k)`. Its size is the\nnumber of elements `< k`, i.e. `cntLess(k)`. Because the selection size\nis `k`, we have `cntLess(k)=k`. Moreover, if some element equaled `k`,\nthat student could not be happy, contradicting feasibility. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every `k (0 ≤ k ≤ n)` the algorithm counts `k` **iff** the two\nconditions of Lemma&nbsp;2 hold.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm computes `cnt = lower_bound(sorted_nums, k)`. By definition\n`cnt = cntLess(k)`.  \n\n*If* `cnt == k` and (`cnt == n` or `sorted_nums[cnt] != k`) then\n`cntLess(k)=k` and the first element `≥ k` is strictly larger than `k`,\nhence no array element equals `k`. Both conditions of Lemma&nbsp;2 hold,\nso the algorithm adds one to the answer.\n\n*Conversely*, if the two conditions of Lemma&nbsp;2 hold, then\n`cntLess(k)=k`. The lower bound index is exactly `k`. Because no element\nequals `k`, the element at that index (if it exists) is larger than `k`,\nso the algorithm’s second test succeeds and it counts `k`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm counts **all** feasible values `k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 a feasible `k` satisfies the two conditions.\nLemma&nbsp;3 shows that any `k` satisfying those conditions is counted.\nTherefore every feasible `k` is counted. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nEvery `k` counted by the algorithm is feasible.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf the algorithm counts `k`, Lemma&nbsp;3 guarantees that the two\nconditions of Lemma&nbsp;2 hold, which by Lemma&nbsp;2 imply feasibility.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the exact number of ways to select a group of\nstudents such that every student is happy.\n\n**Proof.**  \nEach feasible selection corresponds to a unique feasible size `k`\n(because the selection size is `k`).  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm counts every feasible `k`; by Lemma&nbsp;5\nit counts only feasible `k`. Hence the number it outputs equals the\nnumber of feasible selections. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

If no such subsequence exists, `dp[s] = -1`.\n\n*Proof by induction on `i`.*\n\n*Base (`i = 0`).*  \nNo elements processed. Only the empty subsequence exists, giving sum `0` with length `0`. The initialization sets `dp[0]=0` and all other entries to `-1`. The invariant holds.\n\n*Inductive step.*  \nAssume the invariant holds after processing the first `i` elements. Consider element `x = nums[i]`.  \nFor each sum `s` we consider two possibilities:\n\n1. **Do not use `x`.** Then any subsequence achieving `s` is already present among the first `i` elements, with length `dp_old[s]`. The transition never decreases `dp[s]`, so this length remains reachable.\n\n2. **Use `x`.** Any subsequence that uses `x` must have the remaining sum `s‑x` formed by a subsequence of the first `i` elements. By the induction hypothesis the longest such subsequence has length `dp_old[s‑x]`. Adding `x` yields length `dp_old[s‑x] + 1`. The transition sets `dp[s]` to the maximum of its old value and this new candidate, therefore records the longest length among all subsequences that use `x`.\n\nSince the loop iterates `s` from `target` down to `x`, each `dp[s‑x]` used in the update refers to the value *before* `x` is considered, guaranteeing that `x` is counted at most once. Consequently after the updates `dp[s]` equals the longest length achievable with the first `i+1` elements. ∎\n\n\n\n*Lemma 2.* After the whole array is processed, `dp[target]` equals the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` whose sum is `target`, or `-1` if none exists.\n\n*Proof.* Directly from Lemma 1 with `i = n` (all elements processed) and `s = target`. ∎\n\n\n\n*Theorem.* The algorithm returns the required answer.\n\n*Proof.* By Lemma 2, after the loop finishes `dp[target]` is exactly the length of the longest subsequence summing to `target`, or `-1` if impossible.

Decomposing a sub‑array sum\n\nTake any sub‑array.  \nLet it start in copy `q₁` at index `i₁` and end in copy `q₂` at index `i₂`\n(`q₂ ≥ q₁`). Using (1)\n\n```\nsum = (q₂-q₁)·total + (pref[i₂+1] – pref[i₁])          (2)\n```\n\nThe part `pref[i₂+1] – pref[i₁]` is the sum of a **suffix** of one copy\nfollowed by a **prefix** of the next copy.\nIts length is at most `n` (it never contains a whole copy).\n\nTherefore **every** sub‑array can be written as  \n\n```\nsum = k·total + s\n```\n\n* `k` – a non‑negative integer (how many whole copies are completely\n  inside the sub‑array)\n* `s` – the sum of a suffix + a prefix, length ≤ n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.   What do we really need to know?\n\nFor the required `target`\n\n```\ntarget = k·total + s          (3)\n```\n\n`k = target // total` (integer division)  \n`s = target – k·total`   (0 ≤ s < total)\n\nIf we can obtain the remainder `s` with a suffix+prefix,\nthe answer is\n\n```\nanswer = k·n + (minimal length that gives sum s)          (4)\n```\n\nIf `s = 0` the “suffix+prefix” may be empty, its length is `0`.\n\nIf `s` **cannot** be obtained, no sub‑array with sum `target` exists,\nbecause any sub‑array must have the form (3) and the only possible\n`s` values are exactly the sums of suffix+prefixes (length ≤ n).\n\nSo the whole problem reduces to:\n\n*Find the shortest sub‑array of length ≤ n (allowing wrap‑around) whose\nsum equals a given value `s` ( `0 ≤ s < total`).*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Shortest sub‑array of length ≤ n with a given sum\n\nAll numbers are positive → a classic two‑pointer / sliding‑window works.\n\nCreate a temporary array `a = nums + nums` (length `2·n`).  \nAny sub‑array that may wrap around the end of `nums` appears as a normal\nsub‑array inside `a` and its length never exceeds `n`.\n\n```\nleft = 0, cur = 0, best = INF\nfor right in 0 … 2·n-1\n        cur += a[right]\n        while cur > s and left <= right\n                cur -= a[left]\n                left += 1\n        if cur == s and (right-left+1) <= n\n                best = min(best, right-left+1)\n```\n\n* `best` is the minimal length for sum `s`.  \n* If `s == 0` we set `best = 0` immediately (empty sub‑array).\n\nThe loop is `O(n)` because each element is added and removed at most once.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Putting everything together\n\n```\ntotal = sum(nums)\nk     = target // total\ns     = target - k*total          # 0 ≤ s < total\n\nif s == 0:\n        return k * n               # empty suffix+prefix\n\nbest = shortest_len_of_sum_s_in_a(nums, s)   # sliding window described above\nif best == INF:\n        return -1\nelse:\n        return k * n + best\n```\n\nAll calculations use 64‑bit integers (`int` in Python is unbounded).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the length of the shortest sub‑array\nwith sum `target`, or `-1` if none exists.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nEvery sub‑array of `infinite_nums` can be expressed as  \n`k·total + s` where `k ≥ 0` and `s` is the sum of a suffix of `nums`\nfollowed by a prefix of `nums` (the combined length ≤ n).\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake a sub‑array `[l … r]`. Let `l = q₁·n + i₁`, `r = q₂·n + i₂`\nwith `0 ≤ i₁,i₂ < n`.  \nAll whole copies of `nums` that lie completely inside the sub‑array are\nexactly the copies with indices `q₁+1 … q₂-1`. Their total contribution is\n`(q₂-q₁-1)·total`. The remaining part consists of the suffix `i₁ … n-1`\nof copy `q₁` and the prefix `0 … i₂` of copy `q₂`. Their sum is a suffix\nplus a prefix, length ≤ n. Adding the possible whole copy `q₁` (if\n`i₁ = 0`) or `q₂` (if `i₂ = n-1`) does not change the form. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed `s (0 ≤ s < total)` the sliding‑window algorithm returns the\nminimum length (≤ n) of a sub‑array of `infinite_nums` whose sum equals `s`,\nor reports that none exists.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll positive numbers ⇒ the window sum is monotone while expanding the\nright border. The algorithm maintains the invariant that the current\nwindow `[left … right]` is the **shortest** window ending at `right`\nwith sum `≥ s`. Whenever the sum exceeds `s` we shrink from the left until\n`sum ≤ s`. When `sum == s` we have found the shortest window ending at\n`right` with that sum. Scanning all `right` from `0` to `2n-1` examines\nevery possible sub‑array of length ≤ n (including those that wrap) exactly\nonce, and the minimum of their lengths is stored in `best`. If no window\never reaches sum `s`, `best` stays infinite, meaning no such sub‑array\nexists. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf the algorithm returns a value `L = k·n + best` (with `best` finite),\nthere exists a sub‑array of `infinite_nums` of length `L` whose sum is\n`target`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`best` is the length of a suffix+prefix whose sum is `s` (Lemma&nbsp;2).  \nTake any occurrence of that suffix+prefix in the infinite array.\nPrepend `k` whole copies of `nums` (each contributes `total` and length `n`).\nThe total sum becomes `k·total + s = target` and the total length is\n`k·n + best = L`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nNo sub‑array with sum `target` is shorter than the length returned by the\nalgorithm (when it is not `-1`).\n\n**Proof.**  \nAssume a shorter sub‑array exists, of length `L' < L`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 its sum can be written as `k'·total + s'` where `s'` is a\nsuffix+prefix sum (length ≤ n). Because the total sum equals `target`,\n`k' = target // total` (otherwise the remainder would be ≥ total or < 0,\ncontradicting `0 ≤ s' < total`). Hence `k' = k` and `s' = s`.  \nThe suffix+prefix part of this hypothetical sub‑array has length\n`L' - k·n`. Since `L' < k·n + best`, this length is `< best`, contradicting\nthe minimality of `best` (Lemma&nbsp;2). ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nIf the algorithm returns `-1` then no sub‑array of `infinite_nums` sums to\n`target`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`-1` is returned only when the sliding‑window cannot produce sum `s`\n(the remainder). By Lemma&nbsp;2 no suffix+prefix of length ≤ n has sum `s`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 any sub‑array with sum `target` must consist of some\ninteger number `k` of whole copies plus a suffix+prefix whose sum is\nexactly `s`. Since such a suffix+prefix does not exist, no sub‑array with\nsum `target` exists. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe function `minSizeSubarray` returns  \n\n* the length of the shortest sub‑array of `infinite_nums` whose sum equals\n  `target`, or  \n* `-1` if no such sub‑array exists.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf the function returns a positive integer `L`, Lemma&nbsp;3 guarantees a\nsub‑array of that length with sum `target`. Lemma&nbsp;4 shows that no\nshorter one exists, therefore `L` is the optimum.  \nIf the function returns `-1`, Lemma&nbsp;5 proves that a sub‑array with\nsum `target` cannot exist. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.   Complexity Analysis  \n\n*Building the doubled array* – `O(n)` time, `O(n)` extra memory.  \n*Sliding window* – each element is added and removed at most once:  \n`O(n)` time, `O(1)` additional memory.  \n\nOverall  \n\n```\nTime   : O(n)      (n ≤ 10⁵)\nMemory : O(n)      (the doubled array)\n```\n\nBoth satisfy the constraints.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm described above always yields the minimum possible\nfinishing time.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed ordering of processors, assigning the four largest still‑unassigned tasks\nto the earliest free processor never increases the optimal makespan.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider any optimal schedule `S`. Look at the earliest processor `p` (smallest start\ntime) in `S`. Let `M` be the largest task among the four tasks given to `p` in `S`.  \nAll tasks larger than `M` must be assigned to *some* processor, and each of those\nprocessors finishes at least at its start time plus that larger task.  \nIf we replace the four tasks of `p` by the four globally largest remaining tasks,\nthe new largest task for `p` is **at least** `M`.  \nAll other processors keep the same (or larger) largest tasks, therefore their\nfinishing times do not become smaller.  \nThus the makespan cannot increase. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIn an optimal schedule the set of largest‑task‑values, one per processor, consists of\nthe `n` largest tasks of the whole list.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAssume the contrary: there exists an optimal schedule where a task `x` is a largest\ntask of some processor, but a larger task `y` (not a largest task anywhere) exists.\nSince each processor holds four tasks, `y` must be placed together with a task `z`\nthat is **≥** `x` (otherwise `y` would become the largest of its processor).  \nReplace `x` by `y` in the processor that originally owned `x`. Its largest task becomes\n`y` (≥ `x`), so its finishing time does not decrease.  \nThe processor that originally owned `y` now has `x` as its largest task, which is\n≤ `y`, therefore its finishing time does not increase.  \nThe makespan is unchanged, contradicting the assumption that the original schedule\nwas optimal while not using the `n` largest tasks as the per‑processor maxima. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nGiven the processors sorted increasingly and the tasks sorted decreasingly,\npairing `a[i]` with `b[4·i]` (the first element of the i‑th block of four tasks) yields the\nminimum possible value of `max_i (a[i] + b[4·i])`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAfter Lemma&nbsp;2 we know the `n` largest tasks must be the per‑processor maxima.\nThese are exactly `b[0] , b[1] , … , b[n‑1]`.  \nWe have to assign each of them to a distinct processor.  \nFor two sequences `a` (non‑decreasing) and `c` (non‑increasing) the classic\nrearrangement inequality states that the maximum of the pairwise sums\n`a[i] + c[π(i)]` over all permutations `π` is minimised when the smallest `a` is paired\nwith the largest `c`, the second smallest with the second largest, etc.  \nHere `c[i] = b[i]` (the `n` largest tasks in decreasing order).  \nThus the optimal pairing is `a[i]` with `b[i]`.  \nBecause each processor receives **four** tasks, the largest of its four is exactly the\nfirst element of its block, i.e. `b[4·i]`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm\n\n```\nsort processorTime increasingly → a\nsort tasks decreasingly          → b\nanswer = max_{i=0}^{n-1} ( a[i] + b[4·i] )\n```\n\nreturns the minimum possible time when all tasks have finished.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 we can transform any optimal schedule into one where the earliest\nprocessor gets the four globally largest tasks, the second earliest gets the next four,\nand so on, without worsening the makespan.  \nConsequently there exists an optimal schedule that follows exactly the block\nassignment used by the algorithm.\n\nLemma&nbsp;2 guarantees that the per‑processor maxima are the `n` largest tasks,\nand Lemma&nbsp;3 shows that pairing them with the processors in increasing order of\n`processorTime` minimises the maximum sum.  \nThe algorithm computes precisely the makespan of this optimal schedule, therefore it\nproduces the global optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.

By Lemma&nbsp;1 the algorithm,\nwhen processing the middle index `j`, will compute `L ≤ nums[i]` and\n`R ≤ nums[k]`. Since `i` and `k` themselves satisfy the required\ninequalities, `L` and `R` are defined, therefore the algorithm will\nform the candidate `L + nums[j] + R`. Because `L ≤ nums[i]` and\n`R ≤ nums[k]`, this candidate sum is **no larger** than the sum of the\noriginal triplet. Consequently the algorithm’s set of candidates\ncontains a sum that is ≤ the sum of any existing mountain triplet. ∎\n\n\n\n**Theorem**  \nThe algorithm returns  \n\n* the minimum possible sum of a mountain triplet if at least one exists,\n* `-1` otherwise.\n\n*Proof.*  \n\n*Existence case.*  \nLet `S*` be the minimum sum over all mountain triplets.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the algorithm generates a candidate `C` such that\n`C ≤ S*`. On the other hand, every candidate corresponds (by Lemma&nbsp;1)\nto a valid mountain triplet, therefore its sum is ≥ `S*`. Hence\n`C = S*`.

Consequently `answer ≥ dp[p]`, i.e. the algorithm’s result is at\nleast optimal.\n\n*Optimality:*  \nConversely, by Lemma&nbsp;3 each `dp_i` is the best sum of any balanced\nsubsequence ending at `i`.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible number of\noperations, or `-1` when it is impossible.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed target pair `(X , Y)` the procedure `minimal_swaps(X,Y)`\nreturns the smallest number of swaps that makes condition (1) hold for\nall indices `i < n‑1`, or reports impossibility correctly.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider a single index `i`.\n\n*If the original orientation is valid* (`a[i] ≤ X` and `b[i] ≤ Y`) then\nkeeping it satisfies (1) with cost `0`. Any solution that swaps this index\nincurs a strictly larger cost (`1`). Therefore an optimal solution never\nswaps such an index.\n\n*If the original orientation is invalid but the swapped one is valid*,\nthe only way to satisfy (1) for this index is to swap it, costing `1`.\nNo solution with cost `0` exists.\n\n*If both orientations are invalid* then (1) cannot be satisfied for this\nindex under the given `(X , Y)`. Consequently no global solution exists.\n\nBecause the decision for each index is independent of the others,\nchoosing the cheapest feasible orientation for every index yields a\nglobal solution of minimal total cost, and the algorithm does exactly\nthat. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf there exists a sequence of operations that makes the last elements\nthe maxima **without swapping the last index**, then `costA` computed by\nthe algorithm equals the minimum number of swaps among all such\nsequences.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWhen the last index is not swapped we have `X = a[n‑1] , Y = b[n‑1]`.\nAny feasible sequence must satisfy condition (1) with exactly this pair.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 `minimal_swaps(X,Y)` returns the smallest possible number\nof swaps for the remaining indices, which is precisely the optimum among\nall sequences that keep the last index unchanged. This value is `costA`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf there exists a sequence of operations that makes the last elements\nthe maxima **with swapping the last index**, then `costB` computed by the\nalgorithm equals the minimum number of swaps among all such sequences.\n\n**Proof.**  \nSwapping the last index forces `X = b[n‑1] , Y = a[n‑1]` and adds one\nmandatory swap. For the other indices condition (1) must hold with this\npair. By Lemma&nbsp;1 the cheapest way to satisfy it costs\n`minimal_swaps(b[n‑1], a[n‑1])`. Adding the mandatory swap gives exactly\n`costB`. Hence `costB` is the optimum among all sequences that swap the\nlast index. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf a feasible overall solution exists, then at least one of the two\ncases (A or B) is feasible and the algorithm’s answer equals the optimum\noverall number of swaps.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAny feasible solution either swaps the last index or not, therefore it\nbelongs to case A or case B.  \n*If it belongs to case A*, by Lemma&nbsp;2 the algorithm’s `costA` is\nno larger than the number of swaps of that solution.  \n*If it belongs to case B*, by Lemma&nbsp;3 the algorithm’s `costB` is\nno larger than the number of swaps of that solution.  \n\nConsequently `min(costA, costB)` is not larger than the optimum.\nConversely, `costA` (resp. `costB`) is achievable by the construction\nused inside `minimal_swaps`, so the algorithm’s answer is also attainable.\nThus the answer equals the true optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns  \n\n* the minimum possible number of operations that make\n  `nums1[n‑1]` the maximum of `nums1` **and**\n  `nums2[n‑1]` the maximum of `nums2`, or  \n\n* `-1` if no sequence of operations can achieve the goal.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf the algorithm outputs `-1`, both `costA` and `costB` are marked\nimpossible, i.e. for neither `(a[n‑1],b[n‑1])` nor `(b[n‑1],a[n‑1])`\ndoes there exist an orientation of the other indices satisfying (1).\nHence no feasible overall solution exists.\n\nIf the algorithm outputs a non‑negative integer, at least one of the two\ncases is feasible. By Lemma&nbsp;4 the returned value equals the optimum\nover all feasible solutions. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

The relative order of these two balls must change, which can only happen when they are swapped directly or indirectly. Any indirect change still needs at least one adjacent swap where the two balls become neighbours and exchange places. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 2**  \nA single adjacent swap can eliminate at most one inversion.\n\n*Proof.* Swapping neighbours `x` and `y` only changes the order of this pair. All other pairs keep their relative order, so only the inversion status of the pair `(x,y)` may change. Hence at most one inversion is resolved. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 3**  \nThe algorithm’s variable `answer` equals the total number of inversions in the input string.\n\n*Proof.* While scanning from right to left, `zeros` always equals the number of `0`s strictly to the right of the current index. When the current character is `1`, it forms an inversion with each of those zeros, i.e. exactly `zeros` inversions. Adding `zeros` to `answer` counts all inversions whose left element is this `1`. Every inversion has a unique left element, so each is counted exactly once. ∎\n\n\n\n**Theorem**  \n`answer` returned by the algorithm is the minimum possible number of adjacent swaps needed to group all black balls to the right and all white balls to the left.\n\n*Proof.*  \n- *Lower bound*: By Lemma&nbsp;1 each inversion needs at least one swap, so any feasible sequence needs at least `#inversions` swaps. By Lemma&nbsp;3 `answer = #inversions`, thus any solution needs ≥ `answer` swaps.\n- *Achievability*: Perform swaps by repeatedly moving each `1` rightwards across the zeros that are to its right (e.g., bubble‑sort style). Each crossing eliminates exactly one inversion, and there are `answer` inversions, so the process finishes after exactly `answer` swaps. Hence `answer` swaps are sufficient.\n\nSince `answer` is both a lower bound and achievable, it is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\n- **Time**: One pass over the string → **O(n)**\n- **Space**: Only two integer variables → **O(1)**\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumSteps(self, s: str) -> int:\n        \"\"\"\n        Returns the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to move all\n        '1's to the right side of the binary string s.\n        \"\"\"\n        zeros = 0          # number of '0's seen to the right\n        swaps = 0          # total inversions = answer\n\n        # scan from right to left\n        for ch in reversed(s):\n            if ch == '0':\n                zeros += 1\n            else:  # ch == '1'\n                swaps += zeros\n\n        return swaps\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms to the required function signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: invalid decimal literal (<string>, line 38)\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 130, "group_id": 130, "sample_metadata": null}}

Hence a median minimises `f`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nLet the array be sorted. For a fixed size `t` the cheapest `t` elements that\ncan be made equal are a contiguous segment of length `t`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAssume an optimal set `S` of size `t` is not contiguous, i.e. there exist\nindices `a < b < c` with `a,c ∈ S` but `b ∉ S`.  \nBecause the array is sorted, `nums[a] ≤ nums[b] ≤ nums[c]`.  \nReplacing `c` by `b` cannot increase the distance to the median (the median\nlies between `a` and `c`), therefore the total cost does not increase.\nRepeating this argument yields a contiguous segment. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a sorted segment `nums[l … r]` the formula used in `cost(l,r)` equals the\nminimum number of operations required to make all its elements equal.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the optimal target is the median `nums[m]`.  \nThe left part (`l … m-1`) must be increased up to `median`,\ncost `median - nums[i]` for each `i`. Summing gives\n`median·(m-l) - sum_left`.  \nThe right part (`m+1 … r`) must be decreased, cost `nums[i] - median`,\ngiving `sum_right - median·(r-m)`. Adding both parts yields exactly the\nformula. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nDuring the execution of the outer loop (`right` fixed) the inner `while`\nmaintains the invariant  \n\n```\ncost(left, right) ≤ k\n```\n\nand `left` is the smallest index with this property.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWhen `right` is increased, `left` is unchanged, so the invariant may be\nviolated. The `while` loop increments `left` until the condition holds,\ntherefore after the loop it is satisfied.\nIf `left` could be decreased by one and still satisfy the condition,\nthe loop would have stopped earlier, contradicting the loop condition.\nThus the final `left` is minimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nFor every `right` the algorithm records the maximum size of a feasible\nsegment ending at `right`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the segment `[left … right]` is the *largest* segment ending\nat `right` whose cost ≤ k (any larger left index would violate the condition,\nany smaller left index would increase the size).  \nThe algorithm updates `ans` with its length, therefore `ans` is at least the\noptimal size for this `right`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 6  \n`ans` at the end of the algorithm equals the size of the largest feasible\nsegment in the whole array.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider the globally optimal segment `[L … R]`.  \nWhen the outer loop reaches `right = R`, Lemma&nbsp;5 guarantees that the\nalgorithm has examined the maximal feasible segment ending at `R`,\nwhich must be at least `[L … R]` (otherwise `[L … R]` would be feasible and\nlarger, contradicting maximality). Consequently `ans ≥ R-L+1`.  \nConversely `ans` is never larger than a feasible segment size, because it\nis only updated with lengths of segments whose cost ≤ k (Lemma&nbsp;4).  \nThus `ans` equals the optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`maxFrequencyScore` returns the maximum possible score, i.e. the largest\nfrequency achievable after at most `k` operations.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 an optimal solution can be represented by a contiguous\nsegment of the sorted array.  \nLemmas&nbsp;3–6 show that the algorithm finds the largest such segment whose\nrequired number of operations does not exceed `k`.  \nTherefore the returned length is exactly the maximal achievable frequency. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Do the same for `needR`. After that the only untouched\npositions are exactly the type‑both pairs, and the characters still\navailable are the two multisets `remL` and `remR`. Because the numbers are\nequal for each letter, we can pair the copies one‑by‑one: for every\nletter `x` put one copy from `remL` and one copy from `remR` into a\ntype‑both pair. By Lemma&nbsp;3 each such pair becomes equal, therefore\nthe whole string is a palindrome.\n\n*Only‑if part.*  \nSuppose a palindrome can be obtained. Look at the final arrangement.\nAll type‑need‑L positions contain the required letters, therefore the\ncharacters used there are exactly `needL`. The same holds for the right\nside. The remaining characters are precisely those placed in the\ntype‑both pairs, and each such pair consumes one character from the left\nand one from the right of the **same** letter (Lemma&nbsp;3). Consequently\nthe number of remaining copies of each letter on the left equals the\nnumber on the right, i.e. `remL[x] = remR[x]`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 6  \nThe algorithm computes `cntL , cntR , needL , needR` correctly for every\nquery.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`cntL` and `cntR` are direct interval frequency queries on the\npre‑computed prefix tables – by definition they are exact.\n\n`needL` counts, for every `i ∈ L` whose counterpart `j` is **not** in `R`,\nthe character `s[j]`.  \n`j` is exactly `mir[i]`.  \nAll indices of `L` are the interval `[a,b]`.  \nIndices whose counterpart lies in `R` are those also belonging to the\nmirrored interval `M = [n‑1‑d , n‑1‑c]`.  \nHence `needL` = frequencies of `mir` on `[a,b]` **minus** frequencies on\nthe intersection `L ∩ M`. The algorithm performs exactly this subtraction,\nusing the prefix table of `mir`. The same reasoning applies to `needR`\nwith the left‑half characters on `M` minus the intersection. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 7  \nFor every query the algorithm returns `true` **iff** the three conditions\nof Lemma&nbsp;5 (non‑negative remainders and equality of the two remaining\nmultisets) hold.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm checks the non‑negativity of `remL` and `remR` and then\ncompares the two arrays element‑wise. It returns `true` exactly when all\nchecks succeed, i.e. precisely when the conditions of Lemma&nbsp;5 are\nmet. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nFor each query the algorithm outputs `true` exactly when it is possible\nto rearrange the characters inside the given two intervals so that the\nwhole string becomes a palindrome.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If the algorithm outputs `true`.*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;7 the three conditions of Lemma&nbsp;5 hold.\nLemma&nbsp;5 (⇐) guarantees the existence of a concrete arrangement that\nsatisfies all palindrome constraints, therefore the query is feasible.\n\n*If the query is feasible.*  \nAll fixed pairs already match (Lemma&nbsp;1).  \nBecause a feasible arrangement exists, Lemma&nbsp;4 tells us that\n`cntL ≥ needL` and `cntR ≥ needR`.  \nLemma&nbsp;5 (⇒) tells us that the remaining pools are equal,\nhence the three conditions checked by the algorithm hold.\nConsequently the algorithm returns `true`.\n\nThus the algorithm’s answer coincides with the true answer for every\nquery. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

The final value is the minimum of those\nupdates. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor every `k`, `dp[k]` is the minimum total price of a set of purchases\nthat acquires the first `k` fruits.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWe use induction over `k`.\n\n*Base `k = 0`*: `dp[0] = 0`, clearly optimal.\n\n*Induction step*: assume the statement holds for all prefixes shorter than\n`k`.  \nConsider an optimal acquisition of the first `k` fruits.\nLet `j` be the **last** fruit bought in that optimal solution.\nThen `j ≤ k` and `j + j ≥ k` (otherwise fruit `k` would not be covered).\nAll fruits before `j` are acquired optimally, otherwise we could replace\nthat part by a cheaper one and improve the whole solution.\nHence the cost of the optimal solution equals  \n\n```\noptimal cost for first (j‑1) fruits  +  prices[j]\n      = dp[j‑1]                      +  prices[j]      (induction hypothesis)\n```\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 `dp[k]` is the minimum of exactly those expressions over all\nfeasible `j`. Therefore `dp[k]` cannot be larger than the optimal cost,\nand because it is a cost of a concrete feasible set (the one that gave\nthe minimum) it cannot be smaller. Thus `dp[k]` equals the optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe set of purchases reconstructed from the DP (by following the `j`\nthat gave the minimum for `dp[n]`) indeed acquires all `n` fruits.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy construction each chosen purchase `j` covers the interval\n`[j, j+j]`. The DP recurrence guarantees that the next chosen purchase\nstarts at `j+1` (the first fruit not already covered). Repeating this\nprocess until we reach `n` covers the whole range `1 … n`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minimumCoins(prices)` returned by the algorithm is the minimum possible\nnumber of coins needed to acquire all fruits.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFrom Lemma&nbsp;2 with `k = n` we have that `dp[n]` equals the optimal\ncost for the whole array.

otherwise its sum\n  would be `< s₁` and the partition would be invalid.\n  Hence `C₁` ends **at or after** `B₁` and its sum is `≥ s₁`.\n\n* Suppose the first `t` blocks of the two partitions end at the same positions\n  (`t < min(k,m)`).  \n  By the same argument, block `C_{t+1}` cannot end before `B_{t+1}`,\n  otherwise its sum would be `< s_{t+1}` and would be smaller than the\n  previous block sum (which is at least `s_t`).  \n  Therefore `C_{t+1}` also ends **at or after** `B_{t+1}`.\n\nBy induction, each block of the greedy partition ends **no later** than the\ncorresponding block of any other valid partition.\nConsequently the greedy partition cannot have fewer blocks than any other\nvalid partition, i.e. `k ≥ m`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe algorithm always produces a valid (non‑decreasing) partition.\n\n**Proof.**  \nA new block is finished only when its sum `cur_sum` satisfies\n`cur_sum ≥ prev_sum`.  \n`prev_sum` is exactly the sum of the previously finished block,\nso the sequence of sums is non‑decreasing by construction. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`answer` returned by the algorithm equals the maximum possible length of a\nnon‑decreasing array obtainable by the allowed operations.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*By Lemma&nbsp;3* the algorithm yields a feasible partition with `answer` blocks.  \n\n*By Lemma&nbsp;2* no feasible partition can contain more than `answer` blocks.  \n\nTherefore `answer` is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\nThe array is scanned once.\n\n*Time* – `O(n)` where `n = len(nums)`  \n*Memory* – `O(1)` (only a few integer variables)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Reference Implementation  (Python 3)\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def findMaximumLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        prev_sum = 0          # sum of the last finished block\n        cur_sum = 0           # sum of the block we are building now\n        ans = 0               # number of finished blocks\n\n        for x in nums:\n            cur_sum += x\n            if cur_sum >= prev_sum:   # we can close this block\n                ans += 1\n                prev_sum = cur_sum\n                cur_sum = 0\n\n        # any remaining cur_sum is smaller than prev_sum and must be merged,\n        # it does not increase the answer.\n        return ans\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms to\nthe required function signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: 'return' outside function (<string>, line 49)\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 139, "group_id": 139, "sample_metadata": null}}

Hence the farthest last occurrence among those values equals\n`i`. Conversely, if the farthest last occurrence equals `i`, no value seen so\nfar appears later, so ending a segment after `i` does not split any value’s\noccurrences. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nLet `C` be the set of indices identified by the algorithm (`cur == i`).  \nFor any subset `S ⊆ C` the partition obtained by cutting after every index in\n`S` is good.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider a segment `[l, r]` produced by such a cut set.  \nAll indices inside the segment are between two consecutive cuts (or array\nbounds). By construction, the left border `l‑1` (or `-1`) belongs to `C`,\nhence `max last` up to `l‑1` equals `l‑1`. Therefore no value whose first\noccurrence is ≤ `l‑1` appears after `l‑1`. Consequently every value that\nappears inside `[l, r]` has its *first* occurrence ≥ `l` and its *last*\noccurrence ≤ `r`. Thus the whole set of occurrences of each value is\ncontained in this segment, and the segment satisfies the required property.\nAll segments together form a good partition. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nEvery good partition cuts only at indices belonging to `C`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake a good partition and any cut after index `i`. By definition of a good\npartition, no value appears in two different segments, therefore all values\nthat appear in the prefix `0…i` finish inside this prefix. Hence the farthest\nlast occurrence among them is `i`, i.e. `cur == i`. By Lemma&nbsp;1, `i ∈ C`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nLet `k = |C|`. The algorithm returns the exact number of good partitions of\n`nums`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Existence*: By Lemma&nbsp;2, each of the `2^k` subsets of `C` yields a good\npartition, so at least `2^k` good partitions exist.\n\n*Uniqueness*: By Lemma&nbsp;3, any good partition can cut only at positions\nfrom `C`. Its set of cut positions is therefore a subset of `C`. Different\nsubsets give different partitions, so there are **at most** `2^k` good\npartitions.\n\nSince the lower and upper bounds coincide, the number of good partitions is\nexactly `2^k`.

When can a token reach another index ?\n\nCreate a graph whose vertices are the *tokens* (i.e. the array elements).\nConnect two vertices with an edge if the absolute difference of the two\nnumbers is `≤ limit`.\n\n```\nedge (a , b)  ⇔  |a – b| ≤ limit\n```\n\nIf the graph is connected, any token can be moved to any index:\nmove a token along a path, swapping it with the neighbour token at each\nedge.  \nConsequently **all tokens that belong to the same connected component can be\npermuted arbitrarily among the indices that originally contained tokens of\nthis component**.  \nTokens that belong to different components can never meet, because every\npossible swap would need an edge between the two components – such an edge\ndoes not exist.\n\nSo the whole problem reduces to\n\n*find the connected components of the value‑graph, and inside each component\nplace the smallest numbers on the smallest indices.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.   Components are contiguous in sorted order  \n\nSort the pairs `(value , original_index)` by `value`.\n\n```\nv1 ≤ v2 ≤ … ≤ vn\n```\n\nIf `vi+1 – vi > limit` then **no** element on the left side can be connected\nto any element on the right side, because every left value ≤ vi and every\nright value ≥ vi+1, therefore their difference is at least `vi+1 – vi`.\nHence a gap larger than `limit` separates two different components.\n\nConversely, if the gap between two consecutive values is `≤ limit`,\nthe two corresponding vertices are directly connected, therefore they belong\nto the same component.\n\n*Result*: each component is a **contiguous block** in the sorted list.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Construct the answer  \n\n```\n1. sort pairs (value, index) → arr\n2. scan arr, start a new component whenever\n        arr[pos].value – arr[pos‑1].value > limit\n3. for the current component\n        • collect its indices   → idx[]\n        • collect its values    → val[]\n        • sort idx[] increasingly\n        • sort val[] increasingly\n        • write the smallest value to the smallest index,\n          the second smallest value to the second smallest index, …\n4. continue until the whole array is processed\n```\n\nThe produced array is the lexicographically smallest one,\nbecause inside each component we put the smallest possible numbers as early\nas possible, and components are independent.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns exactly the lexicographically smallest\narray reachable by the allowed swaps.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nTwo positions belong to the same connected component of the value‑graph\niff they are in the same block produced by the scanning step\n(`consecutive sorted values differ ≤ limit`).\n\n**Proof.**  \n*If part*: inside a block every consecutive pair of values differs by at most\n`limit`, therefore there is an edge between them. By transitivity of edges,\nall vertices of the block are connected – they belong to one component.\n\n*Only‑if part*: assume two vertices are in the same component but lie in\ndifferent blocks. Then there exists a gap `g > limit` between two consecutive\nsorted values that separates the blocks. Any vertex left of the gap has value\n≤ `x`, any vertex right of the gap has value ≥ `x+g`. Their difference is at\nleast `g > limit`, so no edge can cross the gap – contradiction to the\nassumption that the two vertices are connected. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nInside one component any permutation of its values can be obtained by a\nsequence of allowed swaps.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe component, viewed as a graph on its values, is connected (Lemma&nbsp;1).\nTake any token `t` and any target index `p` that also belongs to the same\ncomponent. Choose a path `t = v0 – v1 – … – vk` from the current vertex of\n`t` to the vertex that currently occupies `p`. Swapping along the edges\n(`vi` with `vi+1`) moves `t` one step forward while preserving the edge\ncondition (the two swapped values are exactly the endpoints of the edge, so\ntheir difference ≤ limit). Repeating this moves `t` to `p`. By moving each\ntoken one after another we can realise any permutation. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a fixed component, the lexicographically smallest arrangement of its\nvalues on its indices is obtained by sorting the indices increasingly and\nplacing the sorted values on them in the same order.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider any arrangement `A` of the component that is not of this form.\nLet `i` be the smallest index where `A` differs from the sorted‑by‑value\narrangement `B`. In `B` the value at `i` is the smallest value that is still\nunused, call it `x`. In `A` a larger value `y > x` occupies `i`.  \nSince both `x` and `y` belong to the same component, by Lemma&nbsp;2 we can\nswap `x` into position `i` (possibly moving other tokens as well) without\naffecting any index `< i`. The resulting array is lexicographically smaller\nthan `A`. Repeating this argument yields exactly arrangement `B`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm produces, for every component, the arrangement described in\nLemma&nbsp;3.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm collects exactly the indices of a component (Lemma&nbsp;1),\nsorts them, sorts the values belonging to the component and writes the\nvalues to the indices in order. This is precisely the construction of\nLemma&nbsp;3. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe array returned by the algorithm is the lexicographically smallest array\nthat can be obtained by any sequence of allowed swaps.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Reachability*:  \nFor each component the algorithm places its values on its indices.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 any permutation of the component’s values is reachable,\nhence the algorithm’s arrangement is reachable.\n\n*Optimality*:  \nAssume there exists a reachable array `R` that is lexicographically smaller\nthan the algorithm’s output `Ans`. Let `p` be the first index where they\ndiffer. `p` belongs to some component `C`.  \nBoth `Ans` and `R` use exactly the same multiset of values of `C` on the\nindices of `C`. By Lemma&nbsp;3 the arrangement of `C` inside `Ans` is the\nlexicographically smallest possible for those indices, therefore the value\nat `p` in `Ans` is **not larger** than the value at `p` in any other reachable\narrangement of `C`, in particular not larger than the value at `p` in `R`.  \nThus `Ans[p] ≤ R[p]`, contradicting the assumption that `R` is smaller at the\nfirst differing position. Hence no such `R` exists and `Ans` is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the number of complete substrings.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nInside a block (where every adjacent pair differs by at most 2) a\nsubstring satisfies the neighbour condition **iff** it is a sub‑interval\nof the block.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe block definition guarantees the condition for *every* adjacent pair\ninside the block. Any sub‑interval inherits those pairs, therefore also\nsatisfies the condition. Conversely, a substring that satisfies the\ncondition cannot cross a border where the condition is violated, thus it\nmust be completely contained in a single block. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nDuring the execution on a block, after the inner `while` finishes,\nthe window `[l , r]` is good **iff** `partial == 0` and `over == 0`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`partial` counts exactly the letters whose frequency lies in `[1,k‑1]`,\n`over` counts exactly the letters whose frequency is `>k`.  \nIf both numbers are zero, every letter has frequency `0` or `k`,\nwhich is precisely the definition of a good window.\nIf at least one of them is positive, a letter violates the definition,\nhence the window is not good. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a fixed right end `r` there is **at most one** left end `l`\nsuch that `[l , r]` is a good window.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAssume two different left ends `l1 < l2` give good windows.\nRemoving the character `word[l1]` from `[l1 , r]` yields `[l1+1 , r]`,\nwhich still contains `word[l2]`.  \nBecause `[l1 , r]` is good, `word[l1]` occurs exactly `k` times in it.\nAfter the removal its frequency becomes `k‑1`, i.e. a *partial* value,\nso `[l1+1 , r]` cannot be good – contradiction. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nWhenever the algorithm adds `1` to the answer, the substring\n`word[l … r]` is a complete substring.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAt that moment the outer loop is at position `r`,\nthe inner `while` has terminated, therefore by Lemma&nbsp;2 the window\nis good. By construction the window lies inside a single block,\nhence by Lemma&nbsp;1 the neighbour condition also holds.\nThus `word[l … r]` satisfies both required properties and is a complete\nsubstring. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nEvery complete substring of `word` is counted exactly once.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake any complete substring `word[i … j]`.  \nIt lies inside a single block (Lemma&nbsp;1).  \nWhen the outer loop reaches `r = j`, the left pointer `l` will be moved\nrightwards until the window becomes good again.\nBecause `word[i … j]` is good, the algorithm cannot move `l` past `i`,\notherwise the window would become bad (Lemma&nbsp;3).  \nConsequently after the inner `while` finishes we have `l = i`,\nthe algorithm adds `1` to the answer (Lemma&nbsp;4) and counts the\nsubstring.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 no other left end can give a good window ending at `j`,\nso the substring is counted only this one time. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`countCompleteSubstrings` returns the exact number of complete substrings\nof `word`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm processes each block independently and sums the results.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 every addition to the sum corresponds to a complete\nsubstring, therefore the returned value is **at most** the true answer.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;5 every complete substring is added exactly once, therefore\nthe returned value is **at least** the true answer.\nBoth inequalities together give equality. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

The array sick contains the positions of the children who are infected with an infectious disease. An infected child at position i can spread the disease to either of its immediate neighboring children at positions i - 1 and i + 1 if they exist and are currently not infected. At most one child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.\nIt can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get infected with the disease. An infection sequence is the sequential order of positions in which all of the non-infected children get infected with the disease. Return the total number of possible infection sequences.\nSince the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.\nNote that an infection sequence does not contain positions of children who were already infected with the disease in the beginning.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 5, sick = [0,4]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Children at positions 1, 2, and 3 are not infected in the beginning. There are 4 possible infection sequences:\n- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected since their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.\nNow, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 2 gets infected.\nFinally, the child at position 3 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 2 and 4 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,2,3].\n- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected because their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.\nNow, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 3 gets infected.\nFinally, the child at position 2 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 1 and 3 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,3,2].\n- The infection sequence is [3,1,2]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4].\n- The infection sequence is [3,2,1]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 4, sick = [1]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Children at positions 0, 2, and 3 are not infected in the beginning.

The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3].\n- The infection sequence is [2,0,3]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3] => [0,1,2,3].\n- The infection sequence is [2,3,0].

Gaps between already infected children  \n\n```\n0 … (first sick) … (second sick) … … (last sick) … n‑1\n```\n\nThe healthy children form several *contiguous* gaps.\n\n* **left end gap** – before the first sick child  \n* **right end gap** – after the last sick child  \n* **internal gaps** – between two consecutive sick children  \n\nFor a gap of length `L`\n\n```\na   (gap)   b          a and b are already infected\n```\n\nthe infection can only start at the two ends of the gap\n(`a+1` and `b‑1`). Afterwards the frontier moves **inwards**.\nThe only freedom is *which side we take next*.\n\n*If the gap is at an end* there is only one side, therefore the order\ninside the gap is forced:\n\n```\nL = 3   →   2,1,0   (only one possible order)\n```\n\n*If the gap is internal* we may take the leftmost or the rightmost\nremaining child while the gap is not empty.\nFor a gap of length `L ≥ 1` the number of possible orders inside this\ngap is\n\n```\n2^(L‑1)                (choose left/right for the first L‑1 steps)\n```\n\n(For `L = 0` the factor is `1`.)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.   Interleaving the gaps  \n\nThe gaps are independent – at any second we may pick the next child from\n**any** gap whose frontier is ready.\nThus we have to interleave the already counted internal orders of the\ndifferent gaps.\n\nIf the gaps have lengths `L1 , L2 , … , Lk` (`Σ Li = M`) and inside gap `i`\nthere are `Ci` possible orders, the total number of global sequences is\n\n```\n   (M)!                     – all permutations of the M children\n   ----------------------------------------------\n   L1! · L2! · … · Lk!       – we must keep the relative order inside each gap\n   ×  C1 × C2 × … × Ck       – the internal possibilities of the gaps\n```\n\nSo finally\n\n```\nanswer =  M!  ·  ( Π internal gaps 2^(Li‑1) )  ·  ( Π all gaps  invFact[Li] )\n```\n\nAll calculations are performed modulo `MOD = 1 000 000 007`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns exactly the number of possible\ninfection sequences.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a gap of length `L`\n\n* if it is an end gap, there is exactly **1** possible order of infection\n  of its children;\n* if it is an internal gap, there are exactly `2^(L‑1)` possible orders.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider an internal gap `a … b` (`a` and `b` already infected).\n\n*Initially* only the two border children `a+1` and `b‑1` are infectable.\nAfter infecting one of them, the new border becomes the next child on\nthe same side. Hence at every step (while the gap is non‑empty) we have\nexactly two choices: leftmost or rightmost remaining child.\nThe process stops after `L` steps, the last step has no choice.\nThus we make a binary decision `L‑1` times → `2^(L‑1)` possibilities.\n\nFor an end gap only one side is adjacent to an infected child,\nso at each step there is a single possible child → exactly one order. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFix the internal order of each gap (as counted in Lemma&nbsp;1).  \nThe number of ways to interleave the `M` infections of all gaps while\npreserving the internal order inside every gap equals  \n\n```\nM! / (L1!·L2!·…·Lk!)\n```\nwhere `Li` are the gap lengths.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake the `M` positions and label each of them by the gap it belongs to.\nWe need a permutation of the `M` labels such that the relative order of\nlabels belonging to the same gap is unchanged.\nThe number of permutations of a multiset with `Li` copies of label `i`\nis the multinomial coefficient `M! / (Π Li!)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a given instance the total number of infection sequences equals  \n\n```\nM! · ( Π internal gaps 2^(Li‑1) ) · ( Π all gaps invFact[Li] )\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 each internal gap contributes a factor `2^(Li‑1)`,\neach end gap contributes factor `1`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the ways to interleave the gaps are `M! / (Π Li!)`.  \nMultiplying both contributions gives the formula, and using modular\ninverse factorials replaces division by `Li!`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm computes exactly the expression of Lemma&nbsp;3.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm\n\n* computes `M = Σ Li` and starts with `ans = fact[M]` → the factor `M!`;\n* iterates over all gaps, multiplies `ans` by `invFact[gap]` → the product\n  `Π invFact[Li]`;\n* for every *internal* gap (`prev != -1`) with `gap > 0` multiplies by\n  `2^(gap‑1)` → the product `Π 2^(Li‑1)` over internal gaps.\n\nThe final multiplication for the rightmost gap adds its `invFact`\nbut never a `2^(…)` factor, exactly as required. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`numberOfSequence` returns the number of possible infection sequences\n(modulo `10^9+7`).\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm returns the value of the expression in\nLemma&nbsp;3. Lemma&nbsp;3 states that this expression equals the exact\ncount of infection sequences. Therefore the returned value is correct. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible size of `s`.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nIn an optimal solution no common value is kept in both arrays.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf a common value `x` is kept in both arrays, we can delete it from one array\nand keep any other value (if a slot is still free) without decreasing the set\nsize, because `x` already contributes one distinct element.  \nThus a solution with the same or larger `|s|` exists where `x` appears in at\nmost one array. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nLet  \n\n```\nkeep1 = min(|only1| , half) ,   keep2 = min(|only2| , half)\n```\n\nThere exists a feasible selection of kept elements that uses exactly\n`keep1` distinct exclusive values from `nums1` and `keep2` distinct exclusive\nvalues from `nums2`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`|only1|` distinct numbers are available only in `nums1`.  \nIf `|only1| ≤ half` we can keep all of them; otherwise we keep any `half`\nof them. The same argument holds for `only2`.  \nAll chosen numbers are distinct and belong to the required array, therefore\nthe selection respects the per‑array capacity `half`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nAfter fixing the `keep1` and `keep2` exclusive values, the maximum additional\ndistinct numbers that can be obtained from the common values equals  \n\n```\nmin( c , n - (keep1 + keep2) )\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe two arrays together have `n` kept slots, `keep1 + keep2` of them are already\noccupied by exclusive values, leaving `n - (keep1 + keep2)` free slots.\nEach common value placed in a free slot adds one new distinct element,\nand by Lemma&nbsp;1 we never need more than one slot per common value.\nHence we can use at most the smaller of the number of common values `c`\nand the number of free slots. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe size `ans = min(keep1 + keep2 + c , n)` is attainable.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake the selection from Lemma&nbsp;2 (uses `keep1 + keep2` slots).  \nIf `keep1 + keep2 + c ≤ n` we have enough free slots to place **all** common\nvalues, one per slot, obtaining `keep1 + keep2 + c` distinct numbers.\n\nIf `keep1 + keep2 + c > n`, the total number of kept elements is only `n`,\nso we cannot exceed `n` distinct numbers.  \nPlace any `n - (keep1 + keep2)` common values into the remaining free slots\n(Lemma&nbsp;3). The resulting set size is `n`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nNo solution can have more than `ans` distinct numbers.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAny solution contains at most `half` distinct numbers from `nums1` and at most\n`half` from `nums2`, therefore at most `n` kept elements in total.\nThe distinct numbers are partitioned into three groups:\nexclusive from `nums1` (≤ `|only1|`), exclusive from `nums2` (≤ `|only2|`),\nand common (≤ `c`).  \nBecause each array can keep at most `half` elements, the number of exclusive\nvalues kept from each side is bounded by `keep1` and `keep2` defined above.\nConsequently the total distinct count is bounded by  \n\n```\nkeep1 + keep2 + min(c , n - (keep1 + keep2)) = ans .\n```\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the maximum possible size of the set `s`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm’s value `ans` can be achieved by a concrete\nselection of kept elements.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;5 no selection can yield a larger set.  \nTherefore `ans` is optimal, and the algorithm is correct. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Taking the minimum over all admissible `p` gives a lower bound\nfor any feasible `S`.  \n\nConversely, pick `p*` that attains the minimum in the transition formula.\nBy the induction hypothesis there exists a concrete optimal transformation\nof the prefix `0 … i-1` that ends with `p*` and uses `dp[i-1][p*]` changes.\nAppending the character `c` (changing `word[i]` if necessary) yields a\nvalid string of length `i+1` with exactly  \n\n```\ncost + dp[i-1][p*] = dp[i][c]\n```\n\nchanges. Hence `dp[i][c]` is both a lower and an upper bound – it is the\noptimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor the whole word, `min_c dp[n-1][c]` equals the minimum number of\noperations that make the entire string satisfy condition (1).\n\n**Proof.** Any final string that satisfies (1) ends with some letter `c`.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the cheapest way to obtain a string ending with that `c`\nneeds `dp[n-1][c]` changes. Taking the minimum over all possible last\nletters yields the overall optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`removeAlmostEqualCharacters` returns the minimum possible number of\noperations required to eliminate all adjacent almost‑equal characters\nfrom the given word.\n\n**Proof.** The algorithm computes the DP table exactly as defined above,\ntherefore Lemma&nbsp;1 holds for every entry.\nThe returned value is `min_c dp[n-1][c]`; by Lemma&nbsp;2 this value is the\nglobal optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible number of\npartitions.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed string (no change) the greedy procedure described in the\nstatement produces the *only* possible sequence of partitions.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe first partition must be a prefix that contains at most `k` distinct\nletters, otherwise the process would stop earlier.\nIf a longer prefix also satisfies the condition, the greedy rule would\nchoose it, because the rule is “take the longest such prefix”.\nThus the first partition is uniquely determined.\nAfter deleting it the same argument applies to the remaining suffix,\nhence every subsequent partition is also uniquely determined. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf we change a character at position `p` to a letter that does **not**\nappear anywhere else in the string, the number of partitions obtained by\nthe greedy process is **at least** the number obtained by any other\npossible change at the same position.\n\n**Proof.**  \nChanging to a new unique letter can only increase the number of distinct\nletters seen while scanning the string.\nWhenever the greedy process would stop because the distinct count would\nexceed `k`, it will also stop after any other change (the distinct count\ncannot be smaller).  \nTherefore the first partition after the change is *not longer* than with\nany other choice of the new letter.\nThe same argument holds for every later partition, because the suffix\nstarting point is the same and the set of distinct letters in the suffix\nis a superset of the set obtained with any other change.\nHence the total number of partitions cannot be smaller. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a fixed change position `p` the algorithm’s simulation (treating\n`s[p]` as a unique special letter) returns exactly the number of\npartitions produced by the optimal change at `p`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the optimal change at `p` is to replace `s[p]` by a letter\nthat never occurs elsewhere.\nThe algorithm simulates precisely this situation (the special index `26`\nrepresents such a letter).  \nThe simulation follows the greedy rule of the statement, therefore by\nLemma&nbsp;1 it yields the unique partition sequence for that modified\nstring, which is the optimal one for position `p`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nAmong all possible ways to change **at most one** character, the maximum\nnumber of partitions equals  \n\n```\nmax_{p = -1 … n-1}   partitions_obtained_by_simulation(p)\n```\n\nwhere `p = -1` denotes “no change”.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*Upper bound.*  \nAny feasible solution either does not change a character (`p = -1`) or\nchanges exactly one character at some position `p`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the number of partitions of that solution is\n`partitions_obtained_by_simulation(p)`.  \nTherefore the optimum cannot exceed the maximum over all `p`.\n\n*Lower bound.*  \nFor each `p` the simulation corresponds to a concrete modification\n(the special unique letter).  \nThus the value `partitions_obtained_by_simulation(p)` is achievable.\nTaking the maximum over all `p` yields a feasible solution whose number\nof partitions is exactly that maximum.\n\nBoth bounds coincide, proving the equality. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`maxPartitionsAfterOperations` returns the maximum possible number of\npartitions after performing the greedy deletions, when we are allowed to\nchange at most one character of `s`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe method enumerates every `p = -1 … n‑1`, runs the simulation described\nin Lemma&nbsp;3 and keeps the largest result.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 this largest result equals the optimum over all allowed\nstrategies. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

By Lemma&nbsp;1 the cheapest such sequence\ncosts exactly `dist[a][b]`. If `dist[a][b] = INF` no sequence exists, thus\nconversion is impossible. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe total cost computed in step 5 equals the sum of the individual minimum\ncosts for all positions, provided conversion is possible for every position.\n\n**Proof.**  \nStep 5 iterates over all positions. For each position it adds exactly the\nvalue described in Lemma&nbsp;2 (or aborts with `-1` if impossible).  \nHence the final `total` is the sum of the per‑position minima. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns  \n\n* the minimum possible total cost to transform `source` into `target`,\n  or  \n* `-1` if such a transformation is impossible.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If the algorithm returns `-1`.*  \nThat happens only when for some position `p` we have `dist[a][b] = INF`\n(step 5).

Counting set bits at a fixed position\n\nConsider a bit position `p` (1‑indexed, i.e. the least significant bit has `p = 1`).\nLet `b = p‑1` be the 0‑indexed position used by the usual formulas.\n\nFor the numbers `0 … N` the number of integers whose `b`‑th bit is `1` is\n\n```\nfull = (N + 1) // 2^{b+1}          # complete cycles of length 2^{b+1}\ncnt  = full * 2^{b}               # each full cycle contributes exactly 2^{b} ones\nrem  = (N + 1) % 2^{b+1}          # incomplete last cycle\ncnt += max(0, rem - 2^{b})        # the remaining part may contain extra ones\n```\n\nThe same formula works for the range `1 … N` because the number `0` contributes\nnothing.\n\nWe denote this function by `ones(N, p)`.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.   Total price for a given `N`\n\nOnly the positions that are multiples of `x` matter:\n\n```\np ∈ { x, 2x, 3x, … }   while p ≤ maxBit(N)\n```\n\n`maxBit(N)` is at most `⌊log2 N⌋ + 1 ≤ 60` for all possible inputs,\nso there are at most `60 / x ≤ 60` such positions – in practice ≤ 8 because\n`x ≥ 1` and `x ≤ 8`.\n\n```\ntotal(N) = Σ_{m≥1, p=m·x ≤ 60}  ones(N, p)\n```\n\nThe computation is `O(number of considered positions)` → at most a few\noperations.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.

The whole algorithm is easily fast enough.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the required maximum `N`.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any `N ≥ 0` and any bit position `p ≥ 1` the function `ones(N, p)` computed\nby the formula in section&nbsp;1 equals the number of integers `num` with\n`1 ≤ num ≤ N` whose `p`‑th bit (1‑indexed) is set.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider the binary pattern of the `p`‑th bit over the natural numbers:\nit consists of blocks of `0`s of length `2^{p-1}` followed by blocks of `1`s of\nthe same length, repeating every `2^{p}` numbers.\nIn the range `0 … N` there are `full = (N+1) // 2^{p}` complete blocks,\neach contributing exactly `2^{p-1}` ones.\nThe remaining part has length `rem = (N+1) % 2^{p}`; it contributes\n`max(0, rem - 2^{p-1})` additional ones.\nSubtracting the contribution of the number `0` (which is `0`) gives the same\ncount for `1 … N`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor any `N ≥ 0` the function `total(N)` returned by the algorithm equals  \n\n```\nΣ_{num = 1..N} price(num)\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \n`price(num)` counts, for that `num`, the set bits whose indices are multiples\nof `x`.  \nSumming over all numbers and swapping the order of summation gives\n\n```\nΣ_{num=1..N} price(num) = Σ_{p∈M}  ( number of num∈[1,N] with bit p = 1 )\n```\n\nwhere `M = { x, 2x, 3x, … }`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the inner quantity is exactly `ones(N, p)`.  \nThe algorithm computes the outer sum over all `p ∈ M` that are ≤ 60, which\ncovers every possible set bit of any `num ≤ N`. Hence `total(N)` equals the\ndesired sum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \n`total(N)` is monotone non‑decreasing in `N`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIncreasing `N` adds one new integer `N+1`. Its price is non‑negative, therefore\n`total(N+1) = total(N) + price(N+1) ≥ total(N)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nAfter the exponential search phase, `total(lo) ≤ k < total(hi)` holds,\nwhere `lo` is the previous value of `hi` (or `0` initially) and `hi` is the\nfirst power of two with `total(hi) > k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe loop starts with `hi = 1` and doubles `hi` while `total(hi) ≤ k`.  \nWhen the loop stops, the current `hi` violates the condition, i.e.\n`total(hi) > k`. The previous value `lo = hi/2` satisfied the loop condition,\nhence `total(lo) ≤ k`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nDuring binary search the invariant  \n\n```\ntotal(lo) ≤ k   and   total(hi) > k\n```\n\nis preserved.\n\n**Proof.**  \nInitially the invariant holds by Lemma&nbsp;4.\nAt each step we test `mid = ⌈(lo+hi)/2⌉`.\n\n*If `total(mid) ≤ k`* we set `lo = mid`.  \n  `total(lo)` stays ≤ k, `hi` unchanged, so invariant holds.\n\n*Otherwise* `total(mid) > k` and we set `hi = mid‑1`.  \n  Because `mid‑1 ≥ lo`, `total(lo) ≤ k` still holds, and `total(hi) = total(mid‑1) > k`\n  (monotonicity, Lemma&nbsp;3). ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 6  \nWhen the binary search terminates, `lo` is the largest integer with\n`total(lo) ≤ k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe loop stops when `lo == hi`. By the invariant `total(lo) ≤ k` and\n`total(hi) > k` cannot both be true, therefore `total(lo) ≤ k` and there is no\ninteger larger than `lo` that still satisfies the inequality; otherwise the\ninvariant would be violated. Hence `lo` is the maximal feasible value. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`findMaximumNumber(k, x)` returns the greatest integer `N` such that the sum of\nprices of all numbers from `1` to `N` does not exceed `k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm computes `total(N)` exactly (Lemma&nbsp;2) and uses a binary\nsearch that, by Lemma&nbsp;6, yields the maximal `N` with `total(N) ≤ k`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

If `p` has `k` digits,\nits most significant digit cannot be `0`, otherwise `x` would have a\nleading zero. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed `k ≥ 1` the set of admissible prefixes `p` of length `k`\nis exactly the set of integers `p` that satisfy both (2) and (3).\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Condition (2)* guarantees that `p` has exactly `k` decimal digits and\nthat its most significant digit is non‑zero and `≤ limit`.  \n*Condition (3)* is obtained by inserting `x = p·10^L + suffix` into the\nglobal interval `[start , finish]` and solving for `p`.  \nBoth conditions are necessary, and together they are sufficient,\nbecause any `p` fulfilling them yields a number `x` that\n\n* has `k+L` digits,\n* ends with `s`,\n* respects the digit limit,\n* lies inside `[start , finish]`.\n\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor any integers `a ≤ b` the value `cnt(b) - cnt(a-1)` equals the number\nof integers `y` with `a ≤ y ≤ b` whose every digit is `≤ limit`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`cnt(t)` counts all numbers `≤ t` with the digit property.\nSubtracting the count for `t = a-1` removes exactly those numbers `< a`,\nleaving the numbers in `[a , b]`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor a fixed `k ≥ 1` the algorithm adds to the answer exactly the number\nof powerful integers whose prefix length is `k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Step 1* computes `lowRange , highRange` – the interval (3).  \n*Step 2* computes `minK , maxK` – the interval (2).  \n`low = max(minK , lowRange)` and `high = min(maxK , highRange)` are the\nintersection of (2) and (3).  \nIf `low > high` there is no admissible prefix, the algorithm adds `0`.\n\nOtherwise, by Lemma&nbsp;3 the term `cnt(high) - cnt(low-1)` counts\nexactly the integers `p` with `low ≤ p ≤ high` whose digits are all\n`≤ limit`.  \nBecause `low , high` already respect (2), every counted `p` has exactly\n`k` digits.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 each such `p` yields a unique powerful integer\n`x = p·10^L + suffix` of prefix length `k`, and every powerful integer\nwith prefix length `k` is produced in this way. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nThe iteration over `totalLen = L … maxLen` enumerates **all** possible\nlengths of powerful integers that can lie in `[start , finish]`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nA powerful integer must contain the suffix `s`, therefore its length is\nat least `L`.  \nIts value does not exceed `finish`, whose decimal length is `maxLen`,\nhence its length cannot be larger than `maxLen`.  \nAll intermediate lengths are feasible (by adding a suitable prefix),\nso the loop covers exactly the possible lengths. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`answer` returned by the algorithm equals the number of powerful\nintegers in the interval `[start , finish]`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n* For `k = 0` (total length `L`) the algorithm adds `1` iff the single\n  number `suffix` lies inside the interval – exactly the correct count.\n\n* For each `k ≥ 1` Lemma&nbsp;4 shows that the algorithm adds precisely\n  the number of powerful integers whose prefix length is `k`.\n\n* By Lemma&nbsp;5 every powerful integer in `[start , finish]` belongs to\n  exactly one of the considered lengths, therefore it is counted once\n  and only once.\n\nSummation over all lengths yields the total number of powerful integers.\n∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

So a suitable `j` exists and the algorithm adds `i`.\n\n*Only‑if* there exists some `j ∈ B` with `|i-j| ≤ k`. Then `j ∈ [lo,hi]`.\nAll elements of `B` smaller than `lo` are before `j`, therefore the first\nelement ≥ `lo` (i.e. `B[pos]`) cannot be larger than `j`. Consequently\n`B[pos] ≤ j ≤ hi`. Hence the condition in the algorithm holds and `i` is added. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 3**  \nThe list produced by the algorithm is sorted in increasing order.\n\n*Proof.* `A` is built by scanning `s` from left to right, therefore its elements\nappear in increasing order.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible OR after at most\n`k` operations.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nMerging a contiguous segment of length `ℓ ≥ 2` into one element yields the\nbitwise AND of all elements of the segment.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`&` is associative and idempotent, therefore repeated pairwise merging\nproduces `a₁ & a₂ & … & a_ℓ`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor any sequence of at most `k` operations the final array corresponds to\na partition of the original array into at least `m = n‑k` contiguous\nblocks, each block value being the AND of its elements.\n\n**Proof.**  \nEach operation reduces the length by one, so after `t ≤ k` operations the\nlength is `n‑t ≥ n‑k = m`.  \nBecause every operation merges two neighbours, the set of positions that\nhave been merged forms disjoint contiguous intervals – a partition.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the value stored for an interval is exactly the AND of its\noriginal elements. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf a partition satisfies condition (2) for a value `X`, then the OR of\nits block values is a subset of `X`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nEvery block value `B` fulfills `B & ~X = 0`, i.e. all bits set in `B` are\nalso set in `X`. The bitwise OR of any collection of such numbers cannot\ncontain a bit outside `X`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor a fixed `X` the greedy scan described in Section&nbsp;3 produces the\nmaximum possible number of blocks among all partitions that satisfy (2).\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider the scan while it processes the array from left to right.\nLet `i` be the first index where the current segment (starting after the\nprevious cut) already satisfies (2). Any valid partition must keep the\nsegment **at least** up to `i`, because before `i` the AND still contains a\nforbidden bit. Cutting **exactly** at `i` therefore leaves the longest\npossible suffix for the remaining elements, which cannot decrease the\ntotal number of blocks achievable later. Repeating this argument for every\ncut shows that the greedy choice never yields fewer blocks than any other\nvalid partition. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \n`feasible(X)` (the greedy scan) returns *True*  **iff** there exists a\npartition with at least `m` blocks whose every block satisfies (2).\n\n**Proof.**  \n*If* the scan returns `True`, it has built a partition with `cnt ≥ m`\nblocks, each obeying (2) by construction – such a partition exists.\n\n*Only‑if*: assume a partition with `p ≥ m` good blocks exists.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the greedy scan creates a partition with **maximum**\npossible number of good blocks, therefore it creates at least `p ≥ m`\nblocks and returns `True`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 6  \nDuring the bit‑building loop, after processing bits `b+1 … 29` the\nvariable `ans` equals the smallest possible value of the final OR whose\nbits higher than `b` are exactly those already fixed in `ans`.\n\n**Proof by induction on the loop.**  \n\n*Base* (`b = 29`): before the first iteration no bits are fixed; the\nstatement is vacuous.\n\n*Induction step*: assume the statement holds before handling bit `b`.\nWe try to keep bit `b` equal to `0`.  \n`trial = ans | ((1<<b)-1)` is the smallest number that keeps all already\nfixed higher bits as in `ans` and allows any pattern for lower bits.\nIf `feasible(trial)` is `True`, by Lemma&nbsp;5 there exists a partition\nwith at most `k` merges whose OR is ≤ `trial`. Because all higher bits are\nalready forced to the minimal possible pattern, the bit `b` can indeed be\n`0`. Hence the minimal achievable value still has bit `b = 0` and `ans`\nremains unchanged.\n\nIf `feasible(trial)` is `False`, no partition can avoid setting bit `b`\nto `1` while keeping higher bits as in `ans`. Consequently every feasible\nOR must have bit `b = 1`; we set it in `ans`. The invariant is restored.\n\nThus after the iteration the invariant holds for the next lower bit. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 7  \nWhen the loop finishes, `ans` is feasible, i.e. there exists a partition\nwith at most `k` merges whose OR is exactly `ans`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAfter the last iteration (`b = 0`) Lemma&nbsp;6 tells us that `ans` is the\nsmallest value whose bits are compatible with all feasibility tests that\nsucceeded. In particular the final test `feasible(ans)` succeeded (otherwise\nthe loop would have set the lowest bit to `1`). By Lemma&nbsp;5 a\npartition with at least `m` blocks exists, which uses at most `k` merges.\nIts OR is a subset of `ans`; because `ans` is the smallest value with this\nproperty, the OR must equal `ans`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minOrAfterOperations` returns the minimum possible bitwise OR of the\narray after performing at most `k` operations.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Existence*: By Lemma&nbsp;7 the algorithm produces a feasible value `ans`,\nso the returned number can be achieved.\n\n*Optimality*: Assume there exists a better answer `Y < ans`.  \nLet `b` be the most significant bit where `Y` and `ans` differ; then `Y`\nhas bit `b = 0` and `ans` has bit `b = 1`. All higher bits are equal.\nWhen the algorithm processed bit `b` it tried exactly the candidate\n`trial = ans_without_bit_b | ((1<<b)-1)`, which is ≤ `Y`.  \nSince `Y` is feasible, `trial` would also be feasible, contradicting the\nfact that the algorithm was forced to set bit `b` to `1`. Hence no such\n`Y` exists.\n\nTherefore `ans` is the minimum achievable OR. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

The perimeter is 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12.\nWe cannot have a polygon with either 12 or 50 as the longest side because it is not possible to include 2 or more smaller sides that have a greater sum than either of them.\nIt can be shown that the largest possible perimeter is 12.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [5,5,50]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: There is no possible way to form a polygon from nums, as a polygon has at least 3 sides and 50 > 5 + 5.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n3 <= n <= 10^5\n1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def largestPerimeter(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        \n```\n\n ### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\n\n", "target": "", "sample_score": {"score": {"value": {"pass": 0.0}, "extracted_prediction": "a_k  <  a₁ + a₂ + … + a_{k‑1}", "prediction": "**Solution Explanation**\n\nFor a set of side lengths `a₁ ≤ a₂ ≤ … ≤ a_k` (`k ≥ 3`) a polygon exists **iff**\n\n```\na_k  <  a₁ + a₂ + … + a_{k‑1}\n```\n\ni.e. the longest side is smaller than the sum of the remaining sides.\nIf we denote  \n\n* `S` – sum of all chosen sides  \n* `M` – the longest side  \n\nthe condition is equivalent to  \n\n```\nS – M  >  M        ⇔        S  >  2·M\n```\n\nThe task is to obtain the **largest possible** perimeter `S` that satisfies the\ninequality, otherwise return `-1`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 1.

Feasibility test for a given `T`\n\n```\nfeasible(T):\n    for each index i\n        find L_i = latest occurrence of i not larger than T\n        if it does not exist → return False\n\n    make a list of pairs (L_i, nums[i])\n    sort the list by L_i (ascending)\n\n    cumDec = 0          # total decrements needed for processed indices\n    marks  = 0          # how many marks are already scheduled (processed)\n\n    for (deadline, dec) in sorted list:\n        cumDec += dec\n        marks  += 1\n        # seconds that are free for decrements up to 'deadline'\n        free = deadline - marks\n        if cumDec > free:          # not enough time for the needed decrements\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nWhy does the test work?\n\n* The list is processed in the order of increasing deadlines.\n  When we have handled the first `k` elements, exactly `k` marks are already\n  fixed (at their deadlines) and `cumDec` decrement operations must be placed\n  **somewhere** before the *k‑th* deadline.\n* The number of free seconds before that deadline is `deadline - k`\n  (all seconds up to the deadline minus the `k` seconds already occupied by\n  the marks).  \n  If `cumDec` exceeds this amount, no schedule can exist.\n* If the test never fails, we can greedily put the needed decrements into\n  any still free seconds – a constructive schedule exists.\n\nThe test runs in `O(n log n)` (sorting) and uses only the pre‑computed\noccurrence lists.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Searching the answer  \n\n`feasible(T)` is monotone:\nif it is possible for some `T`, it is also possible for any larger `T`\n(because we may simply ignore the extra seconds).\n\nTherefore we binary‑search the smallest `T` in `[1, m]` with `feasible(T) = true`.\n\n*If no `T` works, answer is `-1`.*\n\nOverall complexity  \n\n```\nbuilding occurrence lists : O(m)\nbinary search (log m steps) each calling feasible:\n        O(log m * (n log n + n log m))   (log m from binary search,\n                                         log m inside bisect for L_i)\n ≤ O( (n+m) log m )      (n,m ≤ 2000 → easily fast)\n```\n\nMemory consumption is `O(n + m)`.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns exactly the earliest second when all\nindices can be marked, or `-1` if impossible.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed `T`, if there exists any feasible schedule using seconds\n`1 … T`, then there also exists a feasible schedule that marks every index\n`i` at its latest possible occurrence `L_i` (≤ T).\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake any feasible schedule.  \nIf an index `i` is marked at some occurrence `p < L_i`, we can move that\nmark forward to `L_i` because all seconds between `p+1` and `L_i` are\nstill free (they are not used for marking `i` and the value of `i` is already\n`0`). Moving the mark later does not break any other constraint\n(the other indices are unaffected). Repeating this for every index yields a\nschedule that uses exactly the latest possible occurrence for each index. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed `T`, let `L_i` be the latest occurrence of `i` not larger than `T`\n(and assume it exists for every `i`).  \nA schedule that marks each `i` at `L_i` exists **iff** the cumulative\ncondition checked in `feasible(T)` holds for every processed prefix.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*Only‑if* direction:  \nConsider the schedule and look at the moments just after each deadline\n`d` (i.e. after the mark at second `d`).  \nAll marks with deadline ≤ `d` have already taken exactly `|{i | L_i ≤ d}|`\nseconds. The remaining `d - that_number` seconds are the only ones that can\ncontain decrement operations. All indices whose deadline is ≤ `d` must have\nfinished their decrements already, therefore the total number of required\ndecrements up to that point is at most `d - |{i | L_i ≤ d}|`. This is exactly the\ninequality tested by the algorithm for the prefix ending at `d`.\n\n*If* direction:  \nAssume the inequalities hold for every prefix after sorting by deadline.\nWe construct a schedule greedily:\n\n```\nprocess deadlines in increasing order:\n    the current deadline = d, we already placed marks for earlier deadlines\n    we have 'free = d - already_placed_marks' free seconds before d\n    we need 'cumDec' decrement operations for the processed indices\n    because cumDec ≤ free, we can assign the needed decrements to any\n    still unused seconds among the first d-1 positions.\n    finally place the mark at second d.\n```\n\nBecause the inequality guarantees enough free seconds at each step,\nthe construction never fails, yielding a feasible schedule. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \n`feasible(T)` returns *True* **iff** there exists a feasible schedule that\nmarks all indices within the first `T` seconds.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*If* `feasible(T)` is `True`, Lemma&nbsp;2 gives a schedule that marks each\nindex at its latest possible occurrence `L_i` (which is ≤ `T`). Hence a\nfeasible schedule exists.\n\n*If* a feasible schedule exists, by Lemma&nbsp;1 we may assume it uses the\nlatest occurrences `L_i`. Lemma&nbsp;2 then tells us that the cumulative\ncondition must hold, therefore `feasible(T)` returns `True`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf `feasible(T)` is `True` and `T' > T`, then `feasible(T')` is also `True`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll occurrences used for `T` are also present in the prefix `1 … T'`,\nso the same `L_i` are still valid (or become later).  \nThe cumulative inequalities that held for `T` still hold for the same\nprefixes inside `T'`. Adding extra seconds cannot break feasibility. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nThe binary search returns the smallest `T` (if any) such that\n`feasible(T)` is `True`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBinary search on a monotone predicate (Lemma&nbsp;4) is standard:\nit discards the half where the predicate is `False` and finally stores the\nfirst `True` encountered. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns  \n\n* the earliest second `T` ( `1 ≤ T ≤ m` ) at which all indices can be marked,\n  or  \n* `-1` if no such second exists.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If the algorithm returns a positive integer `T`* :  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;5, `feasible(T)` is `True` and `feasible(T-1)` is `False`.  \nLemma&nbsp;3 tells us a schedule exists for `T` but none for `T-1`.  \nHence `T` is exactly the earliest possible second.\n\n*If the algorithm returns `-1`* :  \n`feasible(T)` is `False` for every `T = 1 … m`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 no schedule exists using any prefix of the given seconds,\nso it is impossible to mark all indices at all. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns exactly the minimum required time.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nAfter `t` seconds the string equals `suffix + appended`,\nwhere `suffix = word[t·k … n-1]` and `appended` is any string of length `t·k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nEach second removes the first `k` characters, i.e. shifts the whole string\nleft by `k`. After `t` such shifts the characters that have never been\nremoved are precisely those whose original index `i` satisfies `i ≥ t·k`,\nforming the suffix described. The removed characters are replaced by the\n`k` characters we append in that second; after `t` seconds we have appended\nexactly `t·k` characters, in the order of the seconds. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a given `t` it is possible to obtain the original word after `t` seconds\n*iff* `word[t·k … n-1]` is a prefix of `word`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*If*: assume the suffix is a prefix. Write `word = prefix + rest`,\nwhere `prefix = word[t·k … n-1]`. Choose `appended = rest`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the final string becomes `prefix + rest = word`.\n\n*Only‑if*: suppose we can reach `word` after `t` seconds.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the final string is `suffix + appended = word`.  \nThus `suffix` is the leftmost part of `word`, i.e. a prefix. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf `t·k ≥ n` then the condition of Lemma&nbsp;2 holds (empty suffix).\n\n**Proof.**  \nWhen `t·k ≥ n` the suffix `word[t·k … n-1]` is the empty string, which is a\nprefix of every string. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nLet `t*` be the smallest `t ≥ 1` for which the algorithm returns `t`.\nThen `t*` satisfies the condition of Lemma&nbsp;2.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm checks `t = 1,2,…` in order.\nFor each `t` it either (a) finds `t·k ≥ n` and returns `t`,\nor (b) finds `word[t·k …] == word[:n‑t·k]` and returns `t`.  \nCase (a) is exactly Lemma&nbsp;3, case (b) is the condition of Lemma&nbsp;2.\nHence the returned `t*` always satisfies Lemma&nbsp;2. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nNo integer `t < t*` can bring the string back to its initial state.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf some `t < t*` could, then by Lemma&nbsp;2 the suffix `word[t·k …]` would be a\nprefix of `word`.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible number of\nconsecutive elements.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nDuring the greedy construction, when an element `v` is processed,\nif `v` is free we can safely assign it to `v` (instead of `v+1`) without\ndecreasing the size of the longest consecutive block achievable later.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAssume we assign `v` to `v+1` while `v` is free.\nReplace this assignment by `v`.  \nAll later elements are `≥ v` (array is sorted).  \nIf any later element needed the value `v+1`, it can still take `v+1`\nbecause `v+1` stayed free (we freed it).  \nThus no later placement becomes impossible, and the set of used numbers\ndoes not become less compact. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nThe greedy construction produces a set `U` of distinct numbers that is\n*lexicographically minimal* among all feasible sets of distinct numbers\nobtainable from the array.\n\n**Proof.**  \nProceed by induction over the processing order.\n\n*Base.* After the first element the claim is obvious.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume after handling the first `k‑1` elements the greedy set is the\nsmallest possible prefix.  \nFor the `k`‑th element `v` the greedy rule chooses the smallest free\nvalue among `{v, v+1}` (Lemma&nbsp;1 guarantees this choice never harms\nfuture possibilities).  \nAny other feasible construction must also use a value `≥` this chosen\none, otherwise it would conflict with the already fixed prefix.\nHence after `k` steps the greedy prefix is still the smallest possible.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nLet `U` be the set produced by the greedy algorithm and `L` the length of\nits longest consecutive subsequence.  \nFor **any** feasible set `V` of distinct numbers, the longest consecutive\nsubsequence inside `V` has length at most `L`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBecause of Lemma&nbsp;2, `U` is the smallest (most left‑packed) feasible\nset.  \nTake any consecutive block `B = {a, a+1, …, a+t}` inside an arbitrary\nfeasible set `V`.  \nSince `U` is left‑packed, all numbers `a, a+1, …, a+t` are also present in\n`U` (otherwise `U` would have a gap before `a` while `V` already uses a\nlarger number, contradicting minimality).  \nTherefore `U` contains a consecutive block of at least the same length\n`t+1`.  \nConsequently `t+1 ≤ L`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm returns `L`, the length of the longest consecutive block\ninside `U`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`ordered` is exactly the sorted list of elements of `U`.  \nScanning it while counting runs of `prev+1` computes the maximum length\nof a consecutive subsequence of `U`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the maximum possible number of elements that can be\nselected after the allowed increments.\n\n**Proof.**  \nLet `Ans` be the value returned by the algorithm.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;4, `Ans = L`, the longest consecutive block inside the\ngreedy set `U`.  \nFor any feasible selection of elements, the set of their final values is\nsome feasible set `V`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the longest consecutive block inside `V` has size ≤ `L`.  \nThus no selection can be larger than `Ans`, and the greedy construction\nitself achieves a selection of size `Ans`.  \nHence `Ans` is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

All required multiplicities are satisfied, therefore a subset of\nsize `2·p + c` exists.\n\n*Optimality.*  \nAny valid pattern with base `x` must contain the values\n`x^{2^0}, x^{2^1}, … , x^{2^{m-1}}` at least twice (left and right) and\n`x^{2^m}` at least once. Consequently `cnt[x^{2^i}] ≥ 2` for all\n`i < m`. By definition of `p`, `p` is the maximal index with that\nproperty, therefore `m ≤ p`.

Its size cannot exceed the optimum for that base, which is\ncontained in the set of candidates considered by the algorithm.\nTherefore the algorithm’s maximum is at least the size of any feasible\nsubset, and because each candidate is itself feasible, the maximum is\nexactly the global optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Return the collected characters.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns exactly the string that appears right\nbefore the final operation.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any character `c` and any integer `i (1 ≤ i ≤ freq[c])`,\nthe `i`‑th occurrence of `c` in the original string is removed in round `i`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nRound 1 deletes the first occurrence of each character, therefore the\nfirst occurrence of `c` (i = 1) is removed.  \nAssume the statement holds for all occurrences up to `i‑1`.  \nAfter round `i‑1` the first `i‑1` occurrences of `c` are gone, so the\nfirst remaining `c` is exactly the original `i`‑th occurrence.\nRound `i` deletes the first remaining `c`, i.e. the original `i`‑th one. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nAfter `maxFreq‑1` rounds the remaining string consists precisely of the\nlast occurrences of all characters whose total frequency equals `maxFreq`,\nand no other characters.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake a character `c`.\n\n*If `freq[c] < maxFreq`*: by Lemma&nbsp;1 its `freq[c]`‑th (and last) occurrence\nis removed in round `freq[c] ≤ maxFreq‑1`. Hence `c` disappears completely.\n\n*If `freq[c] = maxFreq`*: by Lemma&nbsp;1 its first `maxFreq‑1` occurrences are\nremoved in rounds `1 … maxFreq‑1`. The only remaining occurrence is the\n`maxFreq`‑th one, i.e. its last occurrence.\n\nThus after `maxFreq‑1` rounds exactly the described characters stay. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe algorithm outputs exactly the characters described in Lemma&nbsp;2,\nin the same order as they appear in the original string.\n\n**Proof.**  \nDuring the second scan the algorithm maintains for each character `c`\nthe number `cnt[c]` of already seen occurrences.\nWhen `cnt[c]` becomes `maxFreq` we are at the `maxFreq`‑th (last) occurrence\nof `c`. The algorithm appends `c` **iff** `freq[c] = maxFreq`,\ni.e. exactly for the characters that survive after `maxFreq‑1` rounds.\nScanning left‑to‑right guarantees the original order. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`lastNonEmptyString` returns the string that is present immediately before\nthe final operation of the described process.\n\n**Proof.**  \nLet `R = maxFreq‑1`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the string after `R` rounds consists of the last occurrences\nof all characters with frequency `maxFreq`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the algorithm returns exactly this set of characters in the\ncorrect order.  \nThe next (final) operation removes those characters, leaving the empty\nstring. Hence the algorithm’s output is precisely the string right before\nthat last operation. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\n*Counting frequencies*: `O(n)` time, `O(1)` extra memory (26 counters).  \n*Second scan*: `O(n)` time, `O(1)` extra memory.  \n\nTotal: **`O(n)` time**, **`O(1)` additional space** (besides the output).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def lastNonEmptyString(self, s: str) -> str:\n        # 1. frequency of each letter\n        freq = [0] * 26\n        for ch in s:\n            freq[ord(ch) - 97] += 1\n\n        max_freq = max(freq)                     # maximal frequency\n        is_max = [f == max_freq for f in freq]   # which letters have it\n\n        # 2. second pass: collect the last occurrence of those letters\n        occ = [0] * 26\n        res = []\n        for ch in s:\n            idx = ord(ch) - 97\n            occ[idx] += 1\n            if is_max[idx] and occ[idx] == max_freq:\n                res.append(ch)\n\n        return ''.join(res)\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms\nto the required function signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: invalid character '\\u2026' (U+2026) (<string>, line 38)\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 180, "group_id": 180, "sample_metadata": null}}

What do we have globally ?\n\nCount all letters in all words.\n\n```\ncnt[c] = total occurrences of letter c\n```\n\nFrom these counts we can build\n\n```\ntotal_pairs = Σ cnt[c] // 2          # number of available equal pairs\ntotal_chars = Σ cnt[c]               # total number of characters\n```\n\n`total_pairs` is the only limited resource, because a centre character can\nalways be taken from the remaining (unused) characters.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Reducing the problem\n\nChoose a subset `S` of the words and make **all** of them palindromes.\nThe subset is feasible iff\n\n```\n Σ_{w in S} (len(w)//2)   ≤   total_pairs                (1)\n```\n\n(the needed pairs do not exceed what we own).\n\nThe number of centre characters that are required is exactly the number of\nchosen odd‑length words, but after using the pairs we still have\n\n```\nremaining_chars = total_chars - 2 * Σ pairs_used\n```\n\ncharacters left, which is always at least the number of required centres,\nso condition (1) is the only real restriction.\n\nConsequently we have to **pick as many words as possible whose\npair‑costs fit into a limited budget `total_pairs`.**  \nAll words have the same profit (1), therefore the optimal strategy is\ngreedy: take the words with the smallest `pairs_needed` first.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible number of\npalindromic words.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any set of words `S` that can be turned into palindromes,\n` Σ_{w∈S} (len(w)//2) ≤ total_pairs`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nEach palindrome needs exactly `len(w)//2` equal pairs of characters.\nAll pairs used by all words of `S` are disjoint, therefore the total number\nof required pairs cannot exceed the number of pairs we own, i.e. `total_pairs`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf a set `S` satisfies ` Σ_{w∈S} (len(w)//2) ≤ total_pairs` then the words\nin `S` can be turned into palindromes.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake the required number of pairs from the global pool and assign them to\nthe symmetric positions of each word in `S`.  \nAfter using those pairs, `total_chars - 2·used_pairs` characters are still\nfree.  \nEvery odd‑length word in `S` needs exactly one centre character; we can give\nany of the free characters to it.  \nThus a concrete palindrome construction exists. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nLet `needs` be the multiset of pair‑costs of all words, sorted increasingly.\nFor any integer `k` the smallest possible total pair cost of **any** `k`\ndifferent words equals the sum of the first `k` elements of `needs`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nSorting puts the cheapest words first. Any other choice of `k` words must\ncontain at least the same number of words whose cost is not smaller than\nthe `k`‑th cheapest one, therefore its total cost cannot be lower. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm returns the largest integer `k` such that the sum of the\n`k` smallest elements of `needs` does not exceed `total_pairs`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm iterates over `needs` in increasing order, accumulating the\nsum until adding the next element would exceed `total_pairs`.  \nConsequently it stops exactly after the maximal prefix whose sum is ≤\n`total_pairs`. The length of this prefix is the described `k`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm outputs the maximum possible number of palindromic words\nobtainable by any sequence of allowed swaps.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Upper bound.*  \nAssume an optimal solution makes `opt` words palindrome.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the total pair cost of those `opt` words is ≤ `total_pairs`.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the cheapest way to obtain `opt` words costs at least the\nsum of the `opt` smallest elements of `needs`. Hence that sum is also ≤\n`total_pairs`. Therefore `opt` cannot be larger than the `k` found by the\nalgorithm (Lemma&nbsp;4).\n\n*Achievability.*  \nThe algorithm selects exactly `k` words whose pair costs are the `k`\nsmallest elements of `needs`. Their total cost is ≤ `total_pairs`. By\nLemma&nbsp;2 these `k` words can indeed be turned into palindromes.\nThus at least `k` palindromes are achievable.\n\nSince no solution can have more than `k` palindromes and `k` palindromes\nare attainable, `k` is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Hence `p` is a common prefix of the pair\n`(x, y)`.\n\n*Only‑if*: If `p` is a common prefix of a pair `(x, y)`, then `p` is a\nprefix of `x` and of `y`.

For a non‑allowed letter `c` we have `cntS[c] ≠ cntT[c]`.  \n   By Lemma&nbsp;1 winning is impossible.\n\n2. For an allowed letter `c` we need more `@` cards from the opposite row\n   than it actually has (i.e. `diff > atT` or `-diff > atS`).  \n   Any winning construction would have to turn at least that many `@`\n   into `c`, contradicting the shortage. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm outputs “Yes” **iff** the player can win the game with cheating.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If* the algorithm outputs “Yes”, it never rejected, therefore by Lemma&nbsp;3\na winning construction exists.\n\n*Only‑if* the player can win, then a construction exists.\nAll non‑allowed letters must already match (Lemma&nbsp;1), and the required\nnumbers of `@` cards for each allowed letter are not larger than the\navailable ones, otherwise the construction would be impossible.\nConsequently the algorithm never encounters a rejecting condition and\noutputs “Yes”. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

DP – feasibility of a suffix  \n\nWhile scanning the string from left to right we have to know whether the\nalready built prefix is\n\n* **equal** to the prefix of `N` (`tight = 0`) or\n* **already smaller** (`tight = 1`).\n\nFor a fixed position `i` and a fixed `tight` we ask:\n\n> *Is it possible to fill the remaining positions `i … L‑1`\n>  so that the whole number does not exceed `N`?*\n\nLet  \n\n```\ndp[i][tight] = True  ⇔  a feasible completion exists\n```\n\n`i` is the index of the current position (0 = most significant).  \n`dp[L][*] = True` – after the last character we have already built a valid\nnumber.\n\nTransition (processed backwards, from `i = L‑1` down to `0`)\n\n```\nfor each allowed bit b at position i\n    if tight == 1:                # already smaller, any b is fine\n        if dp[i+1][1] is True → dp[i][1] = True\n    else:                         # still equal to N so far\n        nb = N's i‑th bit (0 or 1)\n        if b > nb: continue       # would exceed N\n        next_tight = 1 if b < nb else 0\n        if dp[i+1][next_tight] is True → dp[i][0] = True\n```\n\nThe table has only `2·(L+1) ≤ 122` entries – negligible.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm prints the required answer.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor every `i (0 ≤ i ≤ L)` and `tight ∈ {0,1}`  \n`dp[i][tight] = True` **iff** there exists an assignment of bits to the\npositions `i … L‑1` that together with the already fixed prefix\n(respecting `tight`) yields a number `≤ N`.\n\n**Proof.** By induction on decreasing `i`.\n\n*Base (`i = L`).*  \nNo positions are left, the already built number is already ≤ `N`.  \nBoth `dp[L][0]` and `dp[L][1]` are set to `True`. The statement holds.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement true for `i+1`.  \nConsider `dp[i][tight]`.\n\n*If `tight = 1`* (prefix already smaller).  \nChoosing any allowed bit `b` keeps the number ≤ `N`.  \n`dp[i][1]` becomes `True` exactly when there exists a `b` with\n`dp[i+1][1] = True`. By induction hypothesis this is equivalent to the\nexistence of a feasible completion for the suffix – the statement holds.\n\n*If `tight = 0`* (prefix equal to `N` so far).  \nA bit `b` is usable only when `b ≤ N_i` (otherwise the whole number would\nexceed `N`).  \nIf `b = N_i` the new prefix is still equal → next state `tight = 0`.  \nIf `b < N_i` the new prefix becomes smaller → next state `tight = 1`.  \n`dp[i][0]` is set to `True` exactly when there exists an allowed `b`\nfulfilling the above and with `dp[i+1][next_tight] = True`.  \nBy the induction hypothesis this is equivalent to the existence of a\nfeasible completion of the suffix. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf `dp[0][0] = False` then no element of `T` is ≤ `N`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`dp[0][0]` corresponds to the whole string with an initially equal prefix.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 `dp[0][0] = False` means *no* assignment of all bits yields a\nnumber ≤ `N`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nDuring the reconstruction phase the algorithm always chooses a bit that\nkeeps the possibility of completing the remaining suffix.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAt position `i` the current `tight` value equals the one used in the DP.\nThe algorithm examines the allowed bits in descending order.\nFor a candidate bit `b` it checks exactly the condition used in the DP\ntransition:\n\n* `tight = 1` → requires `dp[i+1][1] = True`.\n* `tight = 0` → requires `b ≤ N_i` and `dp[i+1][next_tight] = True`.\n\nIf the condition holds, Lemma&nbsp;1 guarantees that a feasible suffix\nexists, therefore the algorithm never discards all possibilities. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe number produced by the reconstruction is the **largest** element of `T`\nthat does not exceed `N`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWe prove by induction over the positions that after processing the first\n`i` bits the already built prefix is the greatest possible among all\nfeasible numbers.\n\n*Base (`i = 0`).*  \nThe algorithm tries `1` first; if it is feasible (Lemma&nbsp;3) it is chosen,\notherwise `0` is the only feasible choice. Hence the chosen first bit is\nmaximal.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume after `i` positions the built prefix is maximal.\nAt position `i` the algorithm again tries `1` before `0`.  \nIf `1` is feasible, any other feasible number must also have `1` at this\nposition (otherwise it would be smaller).  \nIf `1` is not feasible, every feasible number must have `0` here.\nThus the chosen bit is the greatest possible while keeping feasibility,\nand the new prefix remains maximal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nIf `N ≥ 2^L – 1` the algorithm outputs `max_possible`, the greatest element\nof `T`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll numbers representable with `L` bits are at most `2^L – 1`.  \nWhen `N` is not smaller than this bound, every element of `T` satisfies the\ncondition. Replacing every ‘?’ by `1` yields the maximal element of `T`,\nwhich the algorithm returns directly. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe program prints  \n\n* `-1` iff no element of `T` is ≤ `N`;  \n* otherwise the greatest element of `T` that is ≤ `N`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Case 1 – `N ≥ 2^L – 1`.*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;5 the printed value is the greatest element of `T`,\nwhich is certainly ≤ `N`.\n\n*Case 2 – `N < 2^L – 1`.*  \n\n* If `dp[0][0] = False` the program prints `-1`.  \n  By Lemma&nbsp;2 this is correct.\n\n* If `dp[0][0] = True` the program reconstructs a number.\n  Lemma&nbsp;3 guarantees that the reconstruction never gets stuck,\n  and Lemma&nbsp;4 shows that the obtained number is the largest feasible\n  one. Hence it is exactly the required answer. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm prints `-1` iff reaching `G` within `T`\nmoves is impossible, otherwise it prints the maximum possible number of\ndifferent candies that can be visited.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any two important points `A, B` (start, goal or a candy) the value\n`distAB` computed by BFS equals the length of the shortest walk from `A`\nto `B` that never steps on a wall.\n\n**Proof.** BFS on an unweighted graph (the grid with walls removed) visits\nvertices in non‑decreasing distance from the source, therefore the first\ntime `B` is dequeued the stored distance is the length of a shortest\npath. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor every subset `mask` and every candy `i` whose bit is set in `mask`,\n`dp[mask][i]` after the DP finishes equals the length of the shortest\nwalk that\n\n* starts at `S`,\n* visits **exactly** the candies of `mask` (order arbitrary),\n* ends at candy `i`.\n\n**Proof.** By induction over the number of bits in `mask`.\n\n*Base* – `|mask| = 1`.  \n`mask = {i}`. The DP initialises `dp[mask][i]` with `distS[i]`,\nwhich by Lemma&nbsp;1 is the length of the shortest `S → i` walk,\nand obviously visits exactly the single candy `i`.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement true for all subsets of size `k`.  \nTake a subset `mask` of size `k+1` and a candy `i ∈ mask`.  \nRemove `i` from the subset: `prev = mask \\ {i}`.\nAny optimal walk for `mask` ending at `i` can be split just before the\nlast arrival at `i`. The part before that is a walk that\n\n* starts at `S`,\n* visits exactly the candies of `prev`,\n* ends at some candy `j` (the candy visited just before `i`).\n\nIts length is at least `dp[prev][j]` by the induction hypothesis,\nand the final step from `j` to `i` needs at least `dist[j][i]` moves\n(Lemma&nbsp;1). Hence the whole walk length is at least  \n\n```\nmin_j ( dp[prev][j] + dist[j][i] )\n```\n\nThe DP transition creates exactly this value as a candidate for\n`dp[mask][i]`. Conversely, taking the optimal `j` and concatenating a\nshortest `j → i` walk to an optimal walk for `prev` yields a walk of that\nlength, therefore the DP value is achievable and minimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor any subset `mask` (possibly empty) the value  \n\n```\nbest(mask) =   distSG                         if mask = ∅\n               min_{i∈mask} ( dp[mask][i] + distG[i] )   otherwise\n```\n\nequals the length of the shortest walk that\n\n* starts at `S`,\n* visits **exactly** the candies of `mask` (any order),\n* finishes at `G`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*Empty mask*: the only possible walk is a direct `S → G` walk,\nits shortest length is `distSG` (Lemma&nbsp;1).\n\n*Non‑empty mask*: any feasible walk ends at some candy `i ∈ mask`\njust before the final segment to `G`.  \nThe part up to `i` must be a shortest walk that visits exactly `mask`\nand ends at `i`, whose length is `dp[mask][i]` (Lemma&nbsp;2).  \nThe final segment needs at least `distG[i]` moves (Lemma&nbsp;1).  \nThus the whole walk length is at least `dp[mask][i] + distG[i]`.  \nTaking the minimum over all possible last candies gives a lower bound\n`best(mask)`.  \n\nConversely, for the candy `i` attaining the minimum we can concatenate\na shortest walk realising `dp[mask][i]` with a shortest `i → G` walk,\nobtaining a walk of length exactly `best(mask)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nA subset `mask` is feasible (i.e. there exists a walk from `S` to `G`\nvisiting exactly the candies of `mask` within at most `T` moves)  \niff `best(mask) ≤ T`.\n\n**Proof.** Directly from Lemma&nbsp;3: `best(mask)` is the length of the\nshortest such walk, therefore a walk of length `≤ T` exists exactly when\n`best(mask) ≤ T`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nThe algorithm outputs the maximum cardinality of a feasible subset,\nor `-1` if none exists.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm enumerates **all** subsets (`0 … 2^C‑1`).  \nFor each it computes `best(mask)` using Lemma&nbsp;3 and checks the\ncondition `best(mask) ≤ T` (Lemma&nbsp;4).  \nIf the condition holds, it updates the answer with `popcount(mask)`.  \nConsequently after the loop the answer equals the largest size among\nfeasible subsets, or stays `-1` if no subset (including the empty one)\nis feasible. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe program prints  \n\n* `-1` iff it is impossible to reach the goal within `T` moves,\n* otherwise the maximum possible number of different candies that can be\n  visited on a walk from `S` to `G` of length at most `T`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf reaching `G` at all within `T` moves is impossible, then even the\nempty subset is infeasible, i.e. `best(∅) = distSG > T`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;5 the algorithm outputs `-1`.  \n\nIf at least one walk exists, the empty subset (or some non‑empty one)\nis feasible, so the answer is at least `0`.  \nLemma&nbsp;5 guarantees that the answer equals the largest size of a\nfeasible subset, which is exactly the required maximum number of distinct\ncandies that can be visited. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns exactly the number of replacements\nwithout a DDoS subsequence.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any processed prefix of `S` the values `dp0, dp1, dp2, dp3`\nequal the number of ways to replace the ‘?’ inside this prefix\nsuch that the automaton is in the corresponding state **and**\nthe processed prefix does **not** contain a DDoS subsequence.\n\n**Proof.** By induction over the length of the processed prefix.\n\n*Base* – empty prefix: only the empty replacement exists,\nthe automaton is in state 0, all other counts are `0`. The statement holds.\n\n*Induction step* – assume the statement true for a prefix `P`,\nprocess the next character `c`.\n\n*Case 1 – `c` is a fixed upper‑case `X`*  \n\nAll replacements of the previous prefix are already counted in the DP.\nAppending the fixed character gives exactly the transitions described in\nsection&nbsp;2:\n\n* staying in the same state (ignore the character) – the same number of\n  ways,\n* moving `0 → 1X` – one new way for each previous way in state 0,\n* moving `1X → 2X` – one new way for each previous way in state 1X,\n* moving `3X → forbidden` – these ways are **not** added to any DP\n  entry, therefore they are discarded.\n\nConsequently the formulas for a fixed upper‑case character compute the\ncorrect new numbers.\n\n*Case 2 – `c` is a fixed lower‑case* – analogous, using the transitions\n`2X → 3X` and ignoring the character.\n\n*Case 3 – `c` is ‘?’* – the character may become any of the 52 letters.\nFor each possible concrete letter the same reasoning as in the two fixed\ncases applies.

The algorithm sets `dp[mask][i] = True`.\nThe sequence consisting of the single vertex `i` satisfies the condition,\nand no other sequence ends at a different vertex, matching the DP value.\n\n*Induction step*: assume the statement holds for all masks of size `k`.\nTake a mask of size `k+1` and a vertex `last` with `dp[mask][last] = True`.\nThe algorithm could have set this value only by a transition from some\n`prevMask = mask \\ {last}` and some `prev` with `dp[prevMask][prev] = True`\nand `adj[prev][last] = True`. By induction hypothesis there exists a\nvalid sequence for `prevMask` ending at `prev`; appending `last` (which\nis adjacent) yields a valid sequence for `mask` ending at `last`.\n\nConversely, any valid sequence for `mask` ending at `last` can be split\ninto the prefix (mask without `last`) and the last step `prev → last`.\nThe prefix gives `dp[prevMask][prev] = True` by induction, and because\n`prev` and `last` differ by one character, `adj[prev][last] = True`\n(Lemma&nbsp;1). Hence the transition of the algorithm will set\n`dp[mask][last] = True`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThere exists a Hamiltonian path in the graph **iff**\n`dp[FULL][last] = True` for some `last`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*If* part: a Hamiltonian path visits all vertices exactly once,\nso its vertex set is `FULL`. Its last vertex is some `last`. By Lemma&nbsp;2\nthe DP entry for that pair is `True`.\n\n*Only‑if* part: if `dp[FULL][last] = True`, Lemma&nbsp;2 guarantees a\nsequence covering all vertices exactly once and respecting edges,\ni.e. a Hamiltonian path. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nA Hamiltonian path exists **iff** the original strings can be reordered\nto satisfy the problem statement.\n\n**Proof.** By Lemma&nbsp;1 an edge corresponds precisely to “strings differ\nin exactly one character”. Therefore a Hamiltonian path is exactly a\nreordering where each consecutive pair differs in one character. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm outputs “Yes” exactly when the given strings can be\nreordered to satisfy the required condition.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm prints “Yes” iff `dp[FULL][last]` is true for some `last`.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 this is equivalent to the existence of a Hamiltonian path\nin the graph. By Lemma&nbsp;4 this is equivalent to the existence of a\nvalid reordering of the strings. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Consequently the maximum stored in `answer` is at least the optimum.\nConversely, every value ever stored in `answer` comes from a feasible pair\n(Lemma&nbsp;3), so `answer` never exceeds the optimum.  \nIf no feasible pair exists, the condition `b* ≥ a-D` never holds and\n`answer` remains its initial value `-1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm outputs `-1` iff no pair of gifts satisfies `|a-b| ≤ D`;\notherwise it outputs the maximum possible sum `a+b` among all satisfying\npairs.\n\n**Proof.** Directly from Lemma&nbsp;4. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.
