Replace `OPT` by such a solution (still optimal).\n  The algorithm adds exactly one operation, and by Lemma&nbsp;2 both the\n  algorithm and the new `OPT` make all cells `< i + k` white.\n  Hence after the step they have performed the same number of operations.\n\nThus the invariant holds for all steps, and when the loop ends (`i ≥ n`)\nthe algorithm’s count equals the size of an optimal solution. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nFor each test case the algorithm outputs the minimum possible number of\noperations needed to turn the whole strip white.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the algorithm’s result equals the size of an optimal solution,\nhence it is minimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

What does one deletion do to `odd` ?\n\n* delete a character whose current count is **odd** → it becomes even → `odd` **decreases** by `1`\n* delete a character whose current count is **even** → it becomes odd   → `odd` **increases** by `1`\n\nSo each deletion changes `odd` by `±1`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.   Parity of deletions\n\nFor a concrete letter we may delete it an arbitrary number of times.\nOnly the **parity** (odd / even) of that number matters for the final\nparity of its count.\n\n* let `d_i` – how many times we delete letter `i`\n* `d_i` odd  → the parity of this letter is flipped\n* `d_i` even → parity unchanged\n\nDefine  \n\n```\nx = number of letters for which d_i is odd   (0 ≤ x ≤ m)\n```\n\n`x` is exactly the number of letters whose parity is flipped.\nBecause each odd `d_i` contributes one to the total number of deletions,\n```\nk = (sum of even parts) + x   →   k and x have the same parity\n```\nand obviously `x ≤ k` (every flipped letter needs at least one deletion).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Resulting number of odd counts\n\nLet  \n\n* `flipped_odd` – among the `odd` letters we decide to flip ( `0 … odd` )\n* `flipped_even = x - flipped_odd` – flipped letters that were even\n\nAfter the flips  \n\n```\nodd' = (odd - flipped_odd)          // odd letters we kept unchanged\n       + (flipped_even)            // even letters that became odd\n     = odd + x - 2·flipped_odd\n```\n\n`flipped_odd` can be any integer satisfying  \n\n```\nmax(0, x-(m-odd)) ≤ flipped_odd ≤ min(x, odd)\n```\n\nThe **minimum** possible `odd'` for a fixed `x` is obtained by taking the\nlargest possible `flipped_odd` :\n\n```\nflipped_odd = min(x, odd)\nodd'_min = |odd - x|\n```\n\nThe **maximum** is `odd + x` (no odd letter is flipped).\n\nThus for a given `x` we can obtain **any** value\n\n```\nodd' = |odd - x| , |odd - x|+2 , … , odd + x          (step 2)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   What odd' do we really need ?\n\nThe remaining length after deletions is `len = n - k`.\n\n* if `len` is even → a palindrome needs `odd' = 0`\n* if `len` is odd  → a palindrome needs `odd' = 1`\n\nSo the required value is  \n\n```\nneed = (n - k) mod 2          // 0 or 1\n```\n\nBecause `odd'` always has the same parity as `odd + x`\nand `x` has the same parity as `k`,\n`odd'` automatically has the same parity as `need`\n(the parity condition is always satisfied).\n\nConsequently we only have to be able to make `odd'` **small enough**:\n\n```\nneed = 0  → we need odd' = 0  → we must have |odd - x| = 0  →  x = odd\nneed = 1  → we need odd' = 1  → we need |odd - x| ≤ 1  →  x = odd-1 , odd , odd+1\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.   Feasibility of a candidate `x`\n\nA candidate `x` is feasible iff\n\n* `0 ≤ x ≤ min(k, m)`                (cannot flip more letters than we have deletions or distinct letters)\n* `x ≡ k (mod 2)`                    (parity of flips equals parity of total deletions)\n* `|odd - x| ≤ need`                 (the condition derived above)\n\nIf any of the candidates `odd`, `odd-1`, `odd+1` satisfies all three\nconditions, the answer is **YES**, otherwise **NO**.\n\nAll needed values are obtained from the frequency table in `O(26)` time,\nso the whole algorithm is linear in the total length of the input.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm prints “YES” exactly for the test cases where\nthe required deletions exist.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed number `x` of letters whose deletion count is odd,\nthe smallest possible number of odd‑count letters after all deletions is\n`|odd - x|`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFrom the discussion in section&nbsp;3  \n\n```\nodd' = odd + x - 2·flipped_odd\n```\n\n`flipped_odd` can be at most `min(x, odd)`.  \nIf `x ≤ odd` we set `flipped_odd = x` and obtain `odd' = odd - x`.  \nIf `x > odd` we set `flipped_odd = odd` and obtain `odd' = x - odd`.  \nBoth cases equal `|odd - x|`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed `x` we can obtain **any** odd' with the same parity as\n`odd + x` in the interval `[|odd - x| , odd + x]`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nChanging `flipped_odd` by `+1` decreases `odd'` by `2`.  \nSince `flipped_odd` can be varied by one step through its whole feasible\nrange, all values with step `2` between the minimum (Lemma&nbsp;1) and the\nmaximum (`odd + x`) are reachable. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf a candidate `x` satisfies the three conditions checked by the\nalgorithm, then there exists a way to delete exactly `k` characters so\nthat the remaining multiset can be rearranged into a palindrome.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe three conditions are:\n\n1. `0 ≤ x ≤ min(k,m)` – we can choose `x` distinct letters (all have at\n   least one occurrence) and delete an odd number of times from each,\n   using `x` deletions.\n2. `x ≡ k (mod 2)` – the remaining `k-x` deletions are performed in pairs\n   on any letters; they do not change parities.\n3. `|odd - x| ≤ need` – by Lemma&nbsp;1 the minimal possible odd' after\n   the flips is `|odd - x|`. Because this value is ≤ `need` (which is `0`\n   or `1`) we can, if necessary, increase odd' by `2` using Lemma&nbsp;2\n   until it becomes exactly `need`. The parity matches automatically,\n   so `odd' = need` is attainable.\n\nThus we can realise a deletion pattern with exactly `k` deletions and\n`odd' = need`. Since `need` is `0` for even remaining length and `1` for\nodd remaining length, the remaining characters form a palindrome\nafter reordering. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf the algorithm answers “NO”, then no valid deletion set exists.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAssume a valid deletion set exists. Let `x` be the number of letters whose\ndeletion count is odd in that set.  \nBecause the set is valid, the remaining length is `n-k` and the remaining\nmultiset can be rearranged into a palindrome, therefore `odd' = need`.\n\nFrom Lemma&nbsp;2 we know `odd'` lies in `[|odd - x| , odd + x]` and has the\nsame parity as `odd + x`. Since `odd' = need` (which has that parity),\nwe must have `|odd - x| ≤ need`.  \nFurthermore `x ≤ m` (cannot flip more distinct letters than exist) and\n`x ≤ k` (each flipped letter needs at least one deletion), and `x ≡ k\n(mod 2)` (parity of total deletions). Hence `x` satisfies all three\nconditions checked by the algorithm, contradicting the “NO” answer. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nFor every test case the algorithm prints “YES” iff it is possible to\ndelete exactly `k` characters so that the remaining characters can be\nreordered into a palindrome.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If the algorithm prints “YES”* – by Lemma&nbsp;3 a suitable deletion\nscheme exists.\n\n*If the algorithm prints “NO”* – by Lemma&nbsp;4 no suitable deletion\nscheme exists.\n\nThus the output is correct in both directions. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.   Complexity Analysis  \n\nFor each test case  \n\n* counting frequencies: `O(n)`  \n* computing `odd`, `m`: `O(26)`  \n* checking at most three candidates: `O(1)`\n\nOverall `O(n)` per test case, `O( Σ n )` for the whole input  \n(`Σ n ≤ 2·10⁵`).  \nMemory consumption is `O(1)` besides the input string.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 8.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimal possible number of\noperations.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any element `x` the costs listed in section&nbsp;2 are the exact\nminimal numbers of `+1` operations needed to obtain the corresponding\nproperty.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIncreasing by `1` changes the remainder modulo `m` (`m ∈ {2,3,4,5}`) by\n`+1 (mod m)`. Starting from remainder `r = x mod m` we need\n`(m - r) mod m` steps to reach remainder `0`. This is exactly the formula\nused. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor `k = 2,3,5` the optimal solution consists of making a *single*\narray element satisfy the required divisibility, and the number of\noperations equals the minimum cost among all elements.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe product is divisible by a prime `p` (`p = 2,3,5`) iff at least one\nfactor contains `p`. Changing any element that already contains `p`\nneeds `0` operations, otherwise we must add enough `+1` to create a\nmultiple of `p`. By Lemma&nbsp;1 the cheapest way to do that for a fixed\nposition is its individual cost. Since the product needs only *one*\nsuch element, the globally cheapest way is the minimum of those costs.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor `k = 4` an optimal solution is either  \n\n* (A) one element becomes a multiple of `4`, or  \n* (B) two distinct elements become even.\n\n**Proof.**  \nDivisibility by `4 = 2²` means the total exponent of `2` in the product\nis at least `2`.  \nEvery element contributes either  \n\n* `0` (odd),  \n* `1` (even but not multiple of `4`), or  \n* `2` (multiple of `4`).  \n\nIf some element contributes `2`, we are in case (A).  \nOtherwise all contributions are `0` or `1`; to reach total `2` we need at\nleast two elements contributing `1`, i.e. two even numbers – case (B). ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor `k = 4` the algorithm returns the minimum possible number of\noperations.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*Case (A)* – the cheapest way to make a particular element a multiple of\n`4` is its `cost_mult4` (Lemma&nbsp;1). The cheapest among all elements is\n`min_cost_mult4`, therefore any solution of type (A) needs at least this\nmany operations, and the algorithm can achieve it.\n\n*Case (B)* – to obtain two even numbers we must pick two distinct indices.\nFor each index the cheapest way to become even is its `cost_even`\n(Lemma&nbsp;1). The smallest possible total cost is the sum of the two\nsmallest such values, exactly what the algorithm computes.\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 every feasible solution belongs to (A) or (B), therefore the\nminimum of the two numbers computed by the algorithm equals the optimum.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nFor every test case the algorithm outputs the minimum number of\noperations required to make the product of the array divisible by `k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFour cases for `k`:\n\n* `k = 2,3,5` – optimality follows from Lemma&nbsp;2.\n* `k = 4` – optimality follows from Lemma&nbsp;4.\n\nAll possibilities for `k` are covered, hence the theorem holds. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

After the loop finishes they are respectively the global\nmaximum and minimum among all trucks.

He likes electronic music most of all, so he has created his own system of music notes, which, in his opinion, is best for it.\n\nSince Yarik also likes informatics, in his system notes are denoted by integers of $2^k$, where $k \\ge 1$ — a positive integer. But, as you know, you can't use just notes to write music, so Yarik uses combinations of two notes. The combination of two notes $(a, b)$, where $a = 2^k$ and $b = 2^l$, he denotes by the integer $a^b$.\n\nFor example, if $a = 8 = 2^3$, $b = 4 = 2^2$, then the combination $(a, b)$ is denoted by the integer $a^b = 8^4 = 4096$. Note that different combinations can have the same notation, e.g., the combination $(64, 2)$ is also denoted by the integer $4096 = 64^2$.\n\nYarik has already chosen $n$ notes that he wants to use in his new melody. However, since their integers can be very large, he has written them down as an array $a$ of length $n$, then the note $i$ is $b_i = 2^{a_i}$. The integers in array $a$ can be repeated.\n\nThe melody will consist of several combinations of two notes. Yarik was wondering how many pairs of notes $b_i, b_j$ $(i < j)$ exist such that the combination $(b_i, b_j)$ is equal to the combination $(b_j, b_i)$.

Hence the OR does **not** decrease.\n\nRepeating the move while more than one index receives operations finally yields\na distribution where all `k` operations are on a single index and the OR is\nno smaller than before. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed index `p` the value computed by the algorithm,\n`candidate(p) = (nums[p] << k) | (OR of all other elements)`,\nequals the maximum OR achievable when all `k` operations are applied to `p`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWhen all `k` operations are applied to `p`, its value becomes exactly\n`nums[p] << k`.  \nAll other elements stay unchanged, therefore the OR of the whole array is the\nOR of these two independent parts, which is precisely `candidate(p)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every index `p` the algorithm correctly obtains the OR of all elements\n*except* `p`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`pref[p‑1]` is the OR of indices `0 … p‑1`.  \n`suff[p+1]` is the OR of indices `p+1 … n‑1`.  \nBoth sets are disjoint and together contain every index different from `p`.  \nBitwise OR is associative and commutative, therefore their OR equals the OR of\nall elements except `p`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the maximum possible value of  \n`nums[0] | nums[1] | … | nums[n‑1]` after at most `k` operations.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n1. By Lemma&nbsp;1 an optimal solution exists that puts all `k` operations on a\n   single index `p*`.\n2. For this index the optimal value equals `candidate(p*)` (Lemma&nbsp;2).\n3. The algorithm evaluates `candidate(p)` for **every** index `p`,\n   using the correct OR of the remaining elements (Lemma&nbsp;3), and keeps the\n   maximum over all `p`.\n4. Consequently the returned value is at least `candidate(p*)`, i.e. at least\n   the optimal value, and cannot be larger than the optimum because every\n   `candidate(p)` corresponds to a feasible distribution of the operations.\n   Hence the returned value equals the optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

The algorithm sets `dp[0] = 0`.\n\n*Inductive Step.*  \nAssume the claim holds for all prefixes of length `< i`.  \nConsider an optimal way to cover the prefix `s[:i]`. Two cases are possible for the last character `s[i‑1]`.\n\n1. **`s[i‑1]` is not covered by any dictionary word.**  \n   Then the optimal solution for `s[:i]` consists of an optimal solution for `s[:i‑1]` plus this one extra character.  \n   Its cost is `dp[i‑1] + 1`. The algorithm explicitly considers this value, so `dp[i]` is at most the optimum of this case.\n\n2. **`s[i‑1]` belongs to a dictionary word `w` that ends at position `i`.**  \n   Let `L = len(w)`. The substring `s[i‑L : i]` equals `w`.  \n   The part of the solution before this word is an optimal covering of the prefix `s[:i‑L]`.  \n   By the induction hypothesis its cost is `dp[i‑L]`. Adding the word `w` does not introduce extra characters, so the total cost is `dp[i‑L]`.  \n   The algorithm checks every dictionary word that matches the suffix ending at `i` and updates `dp[i]` with `dp[i‑L]`. Hence `dp[i]` is at most the optimum of this case.\n\nSince any optimal solution must fall into one of the two cases, `dp[i]` is **no larger** than the true optimum.  \nConversely, the algorithm only builds solutions by repeatedly applying the two transitions described above, each of which corresponds to a valid way of covering the prefix. Therefore `dp[i]` is **no smaller** than the optimum.  \nThus `dp[i]` equals the minimum possible number of extra characters for the prefix `s[:i]`.\n\nBy induction the statement holds for all `i`, in particular for `i = |s|`.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the number of integers `x`\nwith  \n\n```\nnum1 ≤ x ≤ num2   and   min_sum ≤ digit_sum(x) ≤ max_sum .\n```\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any decimal string `bound` and any non‑negative integer `S`,\n`F(bound, S)` computed by the DP equals the number of integers `x`\nwith `0 ≤ x ≤ bound` and `digit_sum(x) ≤ S`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nInduction on `pos` (the current digit index).\n\n*Base (`pos = len(bound)`).*  \nAll digits are fixed, the constructed number is exactly one integer.\nThe DP returns `1` iff the accumulated sum `cur` satisfies `cur ≤ S`,\nwhich is precisely the condition `digit_sum(x) ≤ S`.  \n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement holds for position `pos+1`.  \nAt position `pos` the DP tries every digit `d` that does not violate the\ntightness constraint (`d ≤ bound[pos]` if `tight`, otherwise `d ≤ 9`).\nIf `cur+d > S` the branch is discarded – any continuation would keep the sum\n> S, thus cannot contribute a valid number.  \nFor each allowed `d` the DP adds the exact count of valid completions of the\nsuffix, which by the induction hypothesis equals the number of integers whose\nprefix (including `d`) respects the bound and whose total digit sum ≤ S.\nSummation over all admissible `d` therefore yields the total number of valid\nintegers for the current state. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor any `bound` and any `L ≤ R`  \n\n```\n#{ x | 0 ≤ x ≤ bound  and  L ≤ digit_sum(x) ≤ R }\n   = F(bound, R) – F(bound, L-1) .\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \n`F(bound, R)` counts all numbers with digit sum ≤ R.  \n`F(bound, L-1)` counts all numbers with digit sum ≤ L‑1.  \nSubtracting removes exactly those whose sum is ≤ L‑1, leaving those whose\nsum lies in `[L, R]`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nLet `prev = num1-1`. Then\n\n```\n#{ x | num1 ≤ x ≤ num2  and  L ≤ digit_sum(x) ≤ R }\n   = (F(num2,R) – F(num2,L-1)) – (F(prev,R) – F(prev,L-1)).\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \nNumbers in `[0, num2]` with sum in `[L,R]` are counted by the first\ndifference (Lemma&nbsp;2).  \nNumbers in `[0, prev]` with sum in `[L,R]` are counted by the second\ndifference.  \nSubtracting removes the numbers ≤ prev, leaving exactly the numbers in the\ninterval `[num1, num2]`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe function `subtract_one` returns the correct decimal representation of\n`num1-1`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIt mimics elementary subtraction: starting from the least significant digit,\nit changes the first non‑zero digit `d` to `d-1` and turns all following digits\nto `9`. This is precisely the definition of `num1-1`. Leading zeros are\nremoved, preserving the canonical representation. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`Solution.count(num1,num2,min_sum,max_sum)` returns the number of good\nintegers modulo `10⁹+7`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 we obtain the correct string `prev = num1-1`.  \nThe algorithm computes the four values `F(num2, max_sum)`,\n`F(num2, min_sum-1)`, `F(prev, max_sum)`, `F(prev, min_sum-1)`.\nEach `F` is correct by Lemma&nbsp;1.  \nApplying Lemma&nbsp;3 with `L = min_sum` and `R = max_sum` shows that the\ncombination  \n\n```\n(F(num2,max) – F(num2,min-1)) – (F(prev,max) – F(prev,min-1))\n```\n\nequals exactly the number of integers `x` satisfying the problem\nconditions.  \nThe algorithm returns this value modulo `M`, as required. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Consequently we need only `n‑1‑(posn+1) = n‑2‑posn`\nswaps for `n`. Compared with the formula without correction this is exactly\none swap fewer, which is expressed by subtracting `1`.\n\nBoth parts are optimal and independent, therefore the sum (with the possible\n`‑1`) is the overall optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Algorithm\n1.

Hence `ans` swaps achieve a semi‑ordered permutation. ∎\n\n\n\n**Claim 2.** No solution can use fewer than `ans` swaps.  \n\n*Proof.*  \nAny sequence that ends with `1` at index `0` must move `1` left at least `pos1`\npositions, because each adjacent swap changes its index by at most one.\nSimilarly, to place `n` at index `n‑1` we must move it right at least\n`n‑1‑finalPos(n)` positions, where `finalPos(n)` is its index *after* all swaps\ninvolving `1`.  \n\nIf `pos1 < posn`, `1` never passes `n`, so `finalPos(n)=posn` and at least\n`pos1 + (n‑1‑posn)` swaps are necessary.\n\nIf `pos1 > posn`, `1` passes `n` once, increasing `n`'s index by one.\nThus `finalPos(n)=posn+1` and at least `pos1 + (n‑1‑(posn+1)) = pos1 + (n‑2‑posn)`\nswaps are necessary, i.e. `pos1 + (n‑1‑posn) - 1`.\n\nBoth lower bounds equal the value `ans` computed by the algorithm.\nTherefore any feasible solution needs at least `ans` swaps. ∎\n\n\n\n**Theorem.** The algorithm returns the minimum possible number of adjacent\nswaps required to make `nums` semi‑ordered.\n\n*Proof.*  \nBy Claim 1 there exists a sequence of exactly `ans` swaps that succeeds.\nBy Claim 2 no sequence with fewer swaps can succeed.\nHence `ans` is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\n*Scanning* the array once: `O(n)` time, `O(1)` extra space.  \n`n ≤ 50`, well within limits.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def semiOrderedPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        pos1 = posn = -1\n\n        # locate positions of 1 and n\n        for i, v in enumerate(nums):\n            if v == 1:\n                pos1 = i\n            elif v == n:\n                posn = i\n\n        # basic moves\n        moves = pos1 + (n - 1 - posn)\n\n        # if 1 is to the right of n, moving 1 left shifts n right by one\n        if pos1 > posn:\n            moves -= 1\n\n        return moves\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: invalid syntax (<string>, line 38)\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 19, "group_id": 19, "sample_metadata": null}}

Because every possible `end` is tried in the loop,\nthe recursion will follow this sequence of choices and finally reach the\nbase case with `cur == target`. Hence it returns `True`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed integer `i` the algorithm adds `i²` to the answer\n**iff** `i` satisfies the definition of a punishment number.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm computes `sq = i*i` and calls `canPartition(str(sq), i)`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the call returns `True` exactly when the decimal representation\nof `i²` can be partitioned into substrings whose sum equals `i`.  \nThat is precisely the condition in the statement.\nTherefore `i²` is added exactly for those `i`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`punishmentNumber(n)` returns the sum of the squares of all integers\n`i (1 ≤ i ≤ n)` that satisfy the punishment‑number condition.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe loop iterates over every integer `i` in the required range.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;2, during iteration `i` contributes `i²` to `ans` exactly when\n`i` fulfills the condition, and contributes nothing otherwise.\nConsequently after the loop `ans` equals the sum of `i²` over all qualifying\n`i`.

The only feasible state is `dp[0]=0`,\nwhich is clearly optimal. `dp[1]` is impossible → `+∞`.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement true for `i`.  \nWhen we decide `Y[i]` (0 or 1) we obtain a new prefix sum `newSY = p xor Y[i]`.\nAll earlier variables stay unchanged, therefore the cost accumulated so far\nis exactly `dp[p]`.  \n\nIf `i>0` the value of `X[i-1]` becomes known (Lemma&nbsp;1) and we add its\ncost `X[i-1]*(i)`.  \nThe added term `Y[i]*(n-i)` is the cost of the newly taken suffix flip.\nThus the transition computes the exact total cost of a concrete feasible\nchoice extending the optimal solution for state `p`.  \nTaking the minimum over the two possibilities for `Y[i]` yields the optimal\ncost for the new state `newSY`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nAfter the loop finishes (`i = n-1`) for each `p ∈ {0,1}` the value  \n\n```\ndp[p] + (need[n-1] xor p) * n\n```\n\nis the minimum total cost of **all** flips (both prefix and suffix) that\nrealise the target `t` and end with `SY[n-1] = p`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2, `dp[p]` already contains the optimal cost of all flips\nexcept the last prefix variable `X[n-1]`.  \nFormula (4) tells us that `X[n-1] = need[n-1] xor SY[n-1] = need[n-1] xor p`,\nits cost is `n` if it equals `1`. Adding this term gives the exact total\ncost of a feasible complete solution, and because `dp[p]` was optimal,\nthe sum is optimal as well. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor a fixed target `t` the algorithm returns the minimum possible total\ncost to obtain a uniform string equal to `t`.\n\n**Proof", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: invalid syntax.

Its predecessor is earlier in the alphabet, therefore the new\nstring is smaller. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nChanging an `'a'` to `'z'` makes the string lexicographically larger at that\nposition.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`'z'` comes after `'a'` in the alphabet, so at the first differing position the\nnew string is larger. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nLet `i` be the first index with `s[i] ≠ 'a'`.  \nAny optimal operation must include position `i`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf the operation does **not** touch `i`, the prefix `s[0…i‑1]` stays unchanged.\nSince `s[i]` is the first character that can be decreased, leaving it unchanged\ncannot be better than decreasing it (Lemma&nbsp;1).

Decreasing any of them makes the\nstring smaller (Lemma&nbsp;1) and does not affect earlier positions, because\nthe first changed position is already `i`.  \nIf the operation were to extend beyond the block, it would include an `'a'`\n(which would become `'z'`), making the string larger at that later position\n(Lemma&nbsp;2) while not improving any earlier position. Therefore extending\npast the block cannot be optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nIf the whole string consists of `'a'`, the optimal operation changes exactly\nthe **last** character to `'z'`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAny operation must turn at least one `'a'` into `'z'`. Changing a character at\nposition `p` yields a string whose first difference from the original is at `p`\nand is `'z'`. To keep the string as small as possible we want this first\ndifference to appear as far to the **right** as possible, i.e. at the last\nposition. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm described above returns the lexicographically smallest string\nobtainable by performing the operation exactly once.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Case 1 – the input contains a non‑`'a'` character.*  \nLet `i` be the first such index and `B = s[i … j‑1]` the maximal block of\nnon‑`'a'` characters.  \nThe algorithm changes **all** characters of `B` to their predecessors and no\nothers.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 any optimal solution must include `i`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the right end of an optimal solution cannot go beyond `j‑1`.  \nSince decreasing every character of `B` strictly improves the string\n(Lemma&nbsp;1) and no further improvement is possible, the algorithm’s choice\nis optimal.\n\n*Case 2 – the input is all `'a'`.*  \nThe algorithm changes only the last character to `'z'`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;5 this is the unique optimal choice.\n\nBoth cases cover all possible inputs, therefore the algorithm is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

By Lemma&nbsp;2 the stored latest\ntime of `s` is at least `t`, therefore `latest_time[s] ≥ q‑x`.\n\n*Conversely*, if `latest_time[s] ≥ q‑x`, the stored latest time is a\nrequest time `t` with `t ≤ q` (by Lemma&nbsp;2) and `t ≥ q‑x`.

It uses `popcount(T)` powers of\n  two.\n* While the number of summands is smaller than `k`, pick any power `2^p` with\n  `p > 0` and replace it by two copies of `2^{p-1}`. This increases the count\n  by one and keeps the total sum unchanged.\n* Repeating this operation we can reach any count up to `T` (the extreme case\n  is `T` copies of `2^0`).

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns exactly the number of special\npermutations.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any mask and last, `dp[mask][last]` equals the number of special\nsequences that use exactly the elements of `mask` and end with `last`.\n\n**Proof.** By induction over the number of bits set in `mask`.\n\n*Base* – `|mask| = 1`.  \n`mask = 1<<i`, `last = i`. The algorithm sets `dp[mask][i] = 1`,\nwhich is precisely the single sequence `[nums[i]]`. No other sequence\nuses exactly this mask and ends with `i`.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement holds for all masks with `k` bits.\nTake a mask `M` with `k+1` bits and a last element `j` (so `j∈M`).\nEvery special sequence counted in `dp[M][j]` can be written uniquely as\na special sequence `S` of length `k` that ends with some `i` (where\n`i≠j` and `i∈M`) followed by `j`.  \nThe condition that the whole sequence is special is exactly the\ncompatibility between `i` and `j`.  \nConversely, for every `i` compatible with `j` the algorithm adds\n`dp[M\\{j}][i]` to `dp[M][j]`. By the induction hypothesis `dp[M\\{j}][i]`\ncounts all possible prefixes `S`. Therefore after processing all\n`i` the value stored in `dp[M][j]` equals the number of valid sequences\nending with `j`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nWhenever the algorithm performs a transition\n`dp[mask][last] → dp[newMask][next]`,\nthe extended sequence remains special.\n\n**Proof.** The transition is executed only if\n`compatible[last][next]` is true, i.e. `nums[last]` and `nums[next]`\nsatisfy the required divisibility condition. All earlier adjacent pairs\nwere already special by the definition of `dp[mask][last]` (Lemma 1).\nThus the new adjacent pair also satisfies the condition, and the whole\nsequence stays special. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nEvery special permutation of `nums` is counted exactly once in the final\nsum.\n\n**Proof.** Take any special permutation `π`. Scan it from left to right,\nbuilding masks that contain the first `t` elements. After processing the\nfirst `t` elements we are in state `(mask_t, last_t)` where `last_t` is\nthe index of the `t`‑th element. Because each adjacent pair of `π` is\ncompatible, the algorithm will perform the corresponding transition,\nso the DP can follow the whole permutation. By Lemma 1 the number of\nways to reach `(mask_t, last_t)` includes this particular prefix, and\nby Lemma 2 the transition is allowed. Consequently after the last\nelement we reach state `(fullMask, last_n)` and the permutation\ncontributes exactly one to `dp[fullMask][last_n]`. No other distinct\nsequence can lead to the same ordered list of indices, therefore the\npermutation is counted once. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the total number of special permutations of `nums`\nmodulo `10^9+7`.\n\n**Proof.** By Lemma 1 each DP entry counts exactly the special sequences\nwith the described mask and last element. Lemma 2 guarantees that all\ntransitions preserve the special property, so every value stored in the\nDP corresponds to a valid sequence. Lemma 3 shows a bijection between\ncomplete special permutations and the contributions summed in the final\nanswer. Hence the sum equals the desired count. The algorithm performs\nall operations modulo `M`, therefore it returns the count modulo\n`10^9+7`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

No previous gap is removed,\nhence the change is `gap(p,x)`.\n\n*Only successor `s` exists.*  \nSymmetric, change is `gap(x,s)`.\n\n*Neither exists* – the sub‑array consists of a single distinct value,\nimbalance stays `0`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nDuring the inner loop (fixed left border `i`) after processing position\n`j` the variable `cur` equals the imbalance of the sub‑array\n`nums[i … j]`.\n\n**Proof by induction on `j`.**\n\n*Base `j = i`.*  \n`D` is empty, we insert `nums[i]`.  \nIf it is the first element, `Δ = 0` (Lemma&nbsp;2), therefore `cur = 0`,\nwhich is correct because a single element has no gap.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the invariant holds for `j‑1`.  \nWhen extending to `j` we either insert a duplicate (no change) or a new\ndistinct value. By Lemma&nbsp;2 the computed `Δ` equals the true change of\nthe imbalance, therefore `cur + Δ` equals the imbalance of\n`nums[i … j]`. The algorithm sets `cur ← cur + Δ`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor every pair `(i, j)` with `0 ≤ i ≤ j < n` the algorithm adds exactly\nthe imbalance of sub‑array `nums[i … j]` to the answer.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWhen the outer loop is at `i` and the inner loop reaches `j`,\nby Lemma&nbsp;3 `cur` equals the imbalance of `nums[i … j]`. The algorithm\nadds `cur` to the accumulator, hence the contribution is correct. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`sumImbalanceNumbers` returns the sum of imbalance numbers of all\nnon‑empty sub‑arrays of `nums`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll sub‑arrays are uniquely identified by their left and right borders\n`(i, j)`. By Lemma&nbsp;4 each such sub‑array contributes its exact\nimbalance once to the total sum. No other values are added.\nTherefore the final accumulator equals the required sum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

No block can be added, the only valid concatenation is the\nempty one, length `0`. The recurrence also returns `0`.\n\n*Induction step.* Assume the statement true for all states with fewer than\n`k = a+b+c` remaining blocks.\nConsider a state with `k` remaining blocks.\nAny optimal concatenation must start with a block `nxt` that is allowed\nafter `last` (Lemma&nbsp;1). After using this block the problem reduces to\nthe state `(a',b',c', nxt)` with `k‑1` remaining blocks.\nBy the induction hypothesis the optimal continuation from that state has\nlength `dp(a',b',c', nxt)`. Adding the two characters of the first block\ngives total length `2 + dp(a',b',c', nxt)`.  \nThe recurrence takes the maximum over **all** such possible first blocks,\ntherefore its result equals the optimum for the current state. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \n`dp(x, y, z, 0)` equals the maximum length of any valid concatenation that\nuses at most the given numbers of blocks.\n\n**Proof.**  \nState `(x,y,z,0)` has exactly the supplied numbers of blocks available and\nno previous block, i.e. any concatenation we may build starts from scratch.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the DP value is the optimum among all such concatenations,\nwhich is precisely the required answer. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the maximum possible length of a string that can be\nobtained by concatenating some of the given blocks without containing\n`AAA` or `BBB`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm computes `dp(x,y,z,0)` using memoised recursion, which by\nLemma&nbsp;3 equals the optimum length.

The interior of `S` never participates in\nthe decision and does not affect the length added by the next word.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \n`dp[a][b]` after processing the first `i` words equals the minimum possible\nlength of a string that can be obtained from the first `i` words and whose\nfirst character is `a` and last character is `b`.\n\n**Proof by induction over `i`.**\n\n*Base (`i = 1`).*  \nOnly the first word is used. The algorithm sets exactly the pair\n`(first(word0), last(word0))` to `len(word0)`, all other pairs stay `INF`.\nThus the statement holds.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement true after processing words `0 … i‑1`.  \nConsider any optimal construction for the first `i` words that ends with\nfirst character `a'` and last character `b'`.  \nLook at the last operation that introduced `words[i]`.  \nTwo cases:\n\n1. `words[i]` was appended on the right.  \n   Then before this operation the string had first character `a'`,\n   last character `f = words[i][0]`.  \n   By induction hypothesis its length was `dp[a'][f]`.  \n   The algorithm creates exactly the same new length\n   `dp[a'][f] + len(words[i]) - (1 if f == f else 0)` and stores it\n   into `dp[a'][b']`.\n\n2. `words[i]` was prepended on the left.  \n   Symmetric reasoning uses a state `(l , b')` where `l = words[i][-1]`.\n\nThus the algorithm can reach every optimal construction and stores its\nlength. Conversely, every length stored by the transition corresponds to a\nreal construction (the one described in the transition).  \nTherefore after processing word `i` the invariant holds. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nAfter all words are processed, the minimum over all `dp[a][b]` equals the\nminimum possible length of the final string.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 each `dp[a][b]` is the best length among strings that end\nwith that particular pair of border characters.

Afterwards the left border is moved one step right,\nmaintaining correct frequencies for the next iteration.\n\n*If the inner loop stops because `right == n` and `distinct < D`*  \nby Lemma&nbsp;4 there is no complete subarray for this `left` nor for any\nlarger `left`. The algorithm breaks, contributing nothing further, which is\ncorrect.\n\nSince every complete subarray has a unique left border, and for each left\nborder the algorithm counts **all** and **only** the complete subarrays\nstarting there, the sum accumulated in `answer` equals the total number of\ncomplete subarrays. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Since this holds for every valid subarray, `max_len` is at least the\nglobal optimum.

By definition each sub‑array contains exactly one `1`,\nhence the borders between sub‑arrays must lie strictly between two consecutive\n`1`s. Therefore for every gap there is exactly one cut inside it.\n\n*Backward direction*:  \nChoose one cut inside each gap (possible by Lemma&nbsp;1). The part of the\narray left of the first cut contains the first `1` and no other `1`,\nthe part between the first and second cut contains the second `1`, etc.\nThus every resulting sub‑array has exactly one `1`, i.e. the split is good.\n\nBoth mappings are inverse of each other, establishing a bijection. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe number of good splits equals the product  \n`Π (gap_i + 1)` over all gaps.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 a good split is uniquely determined by independent choices,\none per gap. By Lemma&nbsp;1 each gap offers `gap_i + 1` possibilities.\nThe rule of product yields the stated formula. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the number of ways to split `nums` into good sub‑arrays\n(modulo `10^9+7`).\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Case `k = 0`*: No `1` exists, a good sub‑array cannot be formed. The algorithm\nreturns `0`, which is correct.\n\n*Case `k = 1`*: Only one `1` exists, the whole array must be the single sub‑array.\nThe algorithm returns `1`, which is correct.\n\n*Case `k ≥ 2`*:  \nDuring the scan the algorithm visits each `1`. For every pair of consecutive\n`1`s it computes `gap = i - prev - 1` and multiplies the current answer by\n`gap + 1` (modulo `MOD`). By Lemma&nbsp;3 the product of all these factors is\nexactly the total number of good splits.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the exact number of continuous\nsubarrays.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nAt any moment `maxDeque[0]` equals the maximum and `minDeque[0]` equals\nthe minimum of the current window `[left, right]`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBoth deques store elements of the window in monotonic order.\nWhen a new element `x` is appended, all smaller (for `maxDeque`) or\nlarger (for `minDeque`) elements at the back are removed, so the order\nremains monotone and the front is always the greatest / smallest\nremaining element.  \nWhen `left` moves forward, the element that leaves the window is removed\nfrom the front if it equals the front value. Hence the front always\nrepresents the extreme value among the elements still inside the\nwindow. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nAfter the inner `while` loop that possibly moves `left`,\nthe window `[left, right]` satisfies `max – min ≤ 2`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe loop condition is `maxDeque[0] - minDeque[0] > 2`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the left side equals `max - min` of the current window.\nIf it is larger than 2 we increment `left` (removing the leftmost element)\nand update the deques accordingly.  \nThe loop repeats until the condition becomes false, i.e. until\n`max - min ≤ 2`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a fixed `right`, after the adjustment of `left` the index `left`\nis the smallest index such that the subarray `[left, right]` is\ncontinuous.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAssume there exists `k < left` with `[k, right]` continuous.\nWhen `left` was moved from `k` to `k+1`, the loop condition must have\nbeen true, i.e. `max - min > 2` for `[k, right]`.  \nThat contradicts the assumption that `[k, right]` is continuous.\nTherefore no such `k` exists and `left` is minimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe number added to the answer at step `right` (`right-left+1`) equals\nthe number of continuous subarrays that end at position `right`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 every start index `s` with `left ≤ s ≤ right` yields a\ncontinuous subarray `[s, right]`.  \nIf `s < left` the subarray would be invalid (otherwise `left` would not\nbe minimal). Hence the valid starts are exactly the `right-left+1`\nindices in that range, and each corresponds to a distinct subarray. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the total number of continuous subarrays of `nums`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm iterates `right` from `0` to `n-1`.  \nFor each `right` it (1) expands the window, (2) shrinks `left` until the\nwindow becomes valid (Lemma&nbsp;2), (3) adds `right-left+1` to the\nanswer (Lemma&nbsp;4).  \nThus after processing all positions, the sum contains **exactly** all\ncontinuous subarrays, each counted once when its right endpoint is\nprocessed. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the length of the longest\nnon‑decreasing subarray that can be built.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed left border `L` and any index `i ≥ L`,\n`dp0` (`dp1`) after processing `i` is `True`\niff there exists a choice of values for positions `L … i`\nending with `nums1[i]` (`nums2[i]`) that is non‑decreasing.\n\n**Proof.** By induction over `i`.\n\n*Base (`i = L`).*  \nBoth choices are possible, the empty prefix is trivially non‑decreasing,\nso `dp0 = dp1 = True`. The statement holds.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement true for `i‑1`.  \nA non‑decreasing sequence ending with `nums1[i]` must have its previous\nvalue ≤ `nums1[i]`. The previous value can be `nums1[i‑1]` (possible exactly\nwhen `dp0` was `True` at `i‑1`) or `nums2[i‑1]` (possible exactly when `dp1`\nwas `True`). The recurrence for `new_dp0` checks precisely these two\npossibilities, therefore `new_dp0` is `True` exactly when such a sequence\nexists. Same argument for `new_dp1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nWhen the algorithm resets the window at position `i`\n(`new_dp0 = new_dp1 = False`), **no** interval that starts at any index\n`≤ i` can be extended to include position `i`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAssume there existed a feasible interval `[L … i]` with `L ≤ i`.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1, after processing `i` at least one of `dp0, dp1` would be `True`\n(because a feasible sequence ending with either `nums1[i]` or `nums2[i]`\nexists). This contradicts `new_dp0 = new_dp1 = False`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nAt any moment `start` equals the smallest index `L` such that the subarray\n`[L … i]` (current `i`) is feasible.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*Initially* `start = 0`, which is the smallest possible index.  \nWhenever the window is extended (`new_dp0` or `new_dp1` true) the feasibility\nof `[start … i]` holds (Lemma&nbsp;1), and no smaller index can become feasible\nbecause `start` never moves left.  \nWhen a reset happens at `i`, by Lemma&nbsp;2 no interval ending at `i`\nand starting left of `i` is feasible, therefore the smallest feasible start\nis exactly `i`. The algorithm sets `start = i`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor every index `i` the algorithm’s current length `i - start + 1`\nequals the maximum length of a feasible interval that ends at `i`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3, `start` is the *earliest* feasible left border for `i`.\nAny feasible interval ending at `i` must start at some `L ≥ start`,\nhence its length is at most `i - start + 1`.  \nThe interval `[start … i]` itself is feasible (otherwise a reset would have\noccurred), so this bound is attainable. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \n`ans` (the maximum length stored by the algorithm) equals the length of the\nlongest feasible interval in the whole array.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWhenever the scan reaches index `i`, by Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm knows the\nmaximum length of a feasible interval ending at `i` and updates `ans` with it.\nTherefore `ans` is at least the length of any feasible interval.\nConversely, any feasible interval ends at some index `i`; its length is\nconsidered at that step, so `ans` cannot be larger than the optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`maxNonDecreasingLength` returns the maximum possible length of a\nnon‑decreasing subarray that can be obtained by choosing, for each position,\neither `nums1[i]` or `nums2[i]`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm scans the whole array, maintaining the invariant described in\nLemmas&nbsp;1‑4 and finally stores in `ans` the maximum length of any feasible\ninterval (Lemma&nbsp;5). By definition of feasibility (Lemma&nbsp;1) such an\ninterval corresponds exactly to a way of constructing `nums3` whose longest\nnon‑decreasing subarray has that length. Hence the returned value is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

No other case yields `cur_len>0`.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the lemma holds after index `i-1`.  \nConsider the three branches for `diff` at position `i`:\n\n1. `diff == 1`  \n   *If* `cur_len ≥ 2` and `prev_diff == -1`, the algorithm extends the previous\n   alternating subarray by one element, preserving alternation (`-1 → +1`).  \n   *Otherwise* it starts a new subarray of length `2` consisting of the last\n   two elements, which is alternating by definition.\n\n2. `diff == -1` and `prev_diff == 1`  \n   The algorithm appends the current element to the previously alternating\n   subarray; the new difference `-1` correctly follows a `+1`.\n\n3. All other cases  \n   `cur_len` is reset to `0`; no claim is made.\n\nIn every case where `cur_len` becomes positive, the described subarray is\nalternating and has exactly the stored length. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor every alternating subarray `A` of `nums`, the algorithm will at some\niteration set `cur_len` to `|A|`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nLet `A` start at index `l` and end at `r` (`r-l+1 = |A|`).  \nIts first difference (`nums[l+1]-nums[l]`) is `+1`.  \nWhen the loop reaches `i = l+1`, the algorithm either starts a new subarray\n(`cur_len = 2`) or continues a previous one – in any case `cur_len` equals the\nlength of the alternating suffix ending at `i`.  \nFrom the definition of an alternating subarray, each subsequent difference\nalternates `-1, +1, -1 …`. The algorithm’s transition rules exactly match this\npattern, therefore `cur_len` is increased by one at every following index up\nto `i = r`. Consequently after processing `i = r` we have `cur_len = |A|`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \n`answer` is always the maximum length of any alternating subarray seen so far.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`answer` is updated only by `answer = max(answer, cur_len)`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1, each positive `cur_len` equals the length of a *valid*\nalternating subarray ending at the current index. Hence `answer` is the maximum\nover lengths of all such subarrays encountered up to the current point. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns  \n\n* the length of the longest alternating subarray of `nums` if one exists,  \n* `-1` otherwise.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Existence:*  \nIf there is at least one alternating subarray, let `L` be the maximum length.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the algorithm will at some iteration set `cur_len = L`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 `answer` will be at least `L`.  \nNo longer alternating subarray exists, so `answer` cannot exceed `L`.  \nThus `answer = L` and the algorithm returns `L`.\n\n*Non‑existence:*  \nIf no alternating subarray exists, `cur_len` is never set to a positive value,\nhence `answer` stays at its initial value `-1`. The algorithm returns `-1`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\nThe loop runs once over the array (`n ≤ 100`).  \nAll operations are `O(1)`.  \n\n*Time*: `O(n)`  \n*Memory*: `O(1)` (only a few integer variables)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Reference Implementation  (Python 3)\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def alternatingSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        cur_len = 0          # length of current alternating subarray ending at i\n        prev_diff = 0        # sign of the last used difference (1, -1, or 0)\n        answer = -1\n\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            diff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1]\n\n            if diff == 1:\n                # start new or continue after a -1\n                if cur_len >= 2 and prev_diff == -1:\n                    cur_len += 1\n                else:\n                    cur_len = 2          # the pair (i-1, i)\n                prev_diff = 1\n\n            elif diff == -1 and prev_diff == 1:\n                cur_len += 1\n                prev_diff = -1\n\n            else:                       # pattern broken\n                cur_len = 0\n                prev_diff = 0\n\n            answer = max(answer, cur_len)\n\n        return answer\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms to\nthe required function signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: invalid character '\\u2013' (U+2013) (<string>, line 38)\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 56, "group_id": 56, "sample_metadata": null}}

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns `True` **iff** the array can be turned into\nall zeros.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nWhen the algorithm reaches index `i`, `cur` equals the total number of\ndecrements already applied to `nums[i]` by operations whose left end is\nstrictly smaller than `i`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`cur` is the prefix sum of `diff`.  \nEvery time we start `need` operations at position `j` (`j < i`) we do\n`diff[j] += need` and `diff[j+k] -= need`.  \nConsequently `cur` is increased by `need` for all indices `j ≤ t < j+k`,\ni.e. exactly the positions covered by those operations.\nWhen we arrive at `i`, all contributions of operations that started before `i`\nare already added, and none of the future operations (starting at `i` or later)\nhas been added yet. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf at some index `i` the algorithm computes `need = nums[i] - cur > 0`,\nany feasible sequence of operations must start at least `need` operations\nwith left end `i`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the current value of `nums[i]` after all earlier operations is\n`nums[i] - cur`. To reach `0` we have to subtract exactly this amount.\nThe only operations that can affect `i` from now on are those whose left end\nis `i` (later starts are too far right). Each such operation subtracts `1`,\nhence at least `need` of them are necessary. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf the algorithm starts `need` operations at index `i` (when `need>0`),\nthe resulting state of the array after processing index `i` is **identical**\nto any optimal solution that also starts at least `need` operations at `i`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll those `need` operations affect exactly the same segment\n`[i, i+k-1]`. Starting more than `need` operations would over‑decrease\n`nums[i]` (making it negative), which is impossible in a feasible solution.\nThus any feasible solution must start **exactly** `need` operations at `i`,\nand the effect on all positions `≥ i` is the same as in the algorithm. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf the algorithm ever returns `False`, the array cannot be reduced to all zeros.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTwo possible reasons:\n\n1. `need < 0` – this means earlier decisions already decreased `nums[i]`\n   below zero, which contradicts feasibility.\n2. `i + k > n` while `need > 0` – by Lemma&nbsp;2 any feasible solution needs\n   at least `need` operations starting at `i`, but such an operation would\n   exceed the array bounds, impossible.  \n\nHence in both cases no solution exists. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nIf the algorithm finishes the loop without returning `False`, the constructed\nset of operations turns the whole array into zeros.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFor each index `i` we ensured `need = nums[i] - cur ≤ 0` after possibly\nstarting `need` operations. After the update `cur` includes those operations,\nso the effective value of `nums[i]` becomes `0`.  \nBecause later operations start **right** of `i`, they never touch `i` again.\nThus after processing the last index, every position equals `0`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns `True` **iff** it is possible to make all elements of\n`nums` equal to `0` using the allowed operation.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If* part:  \nWhen the algorithm returns `True` it never hit a `False` condition,\nso by Lemma&nbsp;5 the operations it implicitly recorded indeed reduce the\narray to all zeros. Hence a solution exists.\n\n*Only‑if* part:  \nAssume a solution exists. Process the array left‑to‑right.\nAt each index `i` the solution must start at least `need` operations\n(Lemma&nbsp;2). The algorithm also starts exactly `need` operations\n(Lemma&nbsp;3). Therefore the algorithm never encounters a situation where\n`need>0` but the window does not fit, because the existing solution would have\nthe same window. It also never gets `need<0`. Consequently it never returns\n`False` and finally returns `True`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

For example, \"aa\", \"aba\", \"adbgad\", and, \"abab\" are semi-palindrome and \"a\", \"ab\", and, \"abca\" are not.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abcac\", k = 2\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We can divide s into substrings \"ab\" and \"cac\". The string \"cac\" is already a semi-palindrome. If we change \"ab\" to \"aa\", it becomes a semi-palindrome with d = 1.\nIt can be shown that there is no way to divide the string \"abcac\" into two semi-palindrome substrings. Therefore, the answer would be at least 1.\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abcdef\", k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can divide it into substrings \"abc\" and \"def\". Each of the substrings \"abc\" and \"def\" requires one change to become a semi-palindrome, so we need 2 changes in total to make all substrings semi-palindrome.\nIt can be shown that we cannot divide the given string into two substrings in a way that it would require less than 2 changes.\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"aabbaa\", k = 3\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: We can divide it into substrings \"aa\", \"bb\" and \"aa\".\nThe strings \"aa\" and \"bb\" are already semi-palindromes.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible number of changes.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed substring `t` and a fixed divisor `d` of `|t|`,\nthe algorithm computes the exact minimum number of changes needed to make\n`t` a semi‑palindrome with that divisor.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll characters of `t` are split into `d` independent residue classes.\nInside one class we have a string `u` of length `m = |t|/d`.\nChanging `u` into a palindrome can be done independently for each symmetric\npair.  \nIf the two characters of a pair are equal, zero changes are necessary;\notherwise one change (changing either side to the other) is sufficient and also\nnecessary.  \nThus the number of required changes for the class equals the number of\nmismatching pairs, which is exactly what the algorithm counts.\nSummation over the `d` classes gives the total number of changes for this\ndivisor, and no smaller number is possible. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \n`cost[l][r]` equals the minimum number of changes required to turn the\nsubstring `s[l … r]` into a semi‑palindrome (or `INF` if impossible).\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf the length is `1` the definition of semi‑palindrome cannot be satisfied,\nhence `INF` is correct.  \nOtherwise the substring length `L ≥ 2` has a finite set `D` of admissible\ndivisors (`1 ≤ d < L , d | L`).  \nFor each `d ∈ D` Lemma&nbsp;1 gives the exact cost to obtain a semi‑palindrome\nwith that divisor.  \nTaking the minimum over all `d` yields the cheapest way to make the substring\na semi‑palindrome, which is precisely what the algorithm stores in\n`cost[l][r]`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every `i (0 ≤ i ≤ n)` and `p (0 ≤ p ≤ k)` the DP value `dp[i][p]`\nequals the minimum total number of changes needed to transform the prefix\n`s[0 … i‑1]` into exactly `p` semi‑palindromic substrings (each of length ≥ 2).\n\n**Proof.**  \nInduction over `i`.\n\n*Base `i = 0`.*  \nOnly `p = 0` is feasible, and `dp[0][0] = 0` is optimal. All other `dp[0][p]`\nstay `INF`, which is correct because a non‑empty number of substrings cannot\ncover an empty prefix.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement holds for all smaller prefixes.\nConsider an optimal partition of the first `i` characters into `p` parts.\nLet the last part start at position `j` (`0 ≤ j < i`) and have length `i‑j ≥ 2`.\nThe first `j` characters are partitioned optimally into `p‑1` parts,\notherwise we could replace them by a cheaper one and improve the whole\nsolution – contradiction.  \nHence the optimal total cost equals  \n\n```\n   optimal = dp[j][p‑1]  +  cost[j][i‑1]\n```\n\nwhere `cost[j][i‑1]` is the cheapest way to make the last piece a\nsemi‑palindrome (Lemma&nbsp;2).  \nThe DP transition examines **all** admissible `j` and stores the minimum of\nexactly those expressions, therefore `dp[i][p]` cannot be larger than the\noptimal value.\n\nConversely, any value produced by the transition corresponds to a concrete\nchoice of `j`, a feasible partition of the prefix `0 … j‑1` (by induction\nhypothesis) and a feasible transformation of the last piece (by Lemma&nbsp;2).\nThus the DP never creates an impossible solution, and `dp[i][p]` cannot be\nsmaller than the optimum.\n\nBoth directions together prove the equality. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe answer returned by the algorithm, `dp[n][k]`, is the minimum number of\nchanges required to split the whole string `s` into exactly `k`\nsemi‑palindromic substrings.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 `dp[n][k]` is the optimum for the whole string (prefix of length\n`n`) with `k` parts, which is exactly the problem statement. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minimumChanges` returns the minimum possible number of character changes\nnecessary to partition the given string `s` into `k` substrings, each of which\ncan be turned into a semi‑palindrome.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm first computes `cost[l][r]` which is correct by Lemma&nbsp;2.\nUsing these costs, the DP computes `dp[n][k]`, which equals the optimal total\ncost by Lemma&nbsp;4.

When the separator appears at the\nbeginning, the end, or consecutively, `split` produces empty strings (`''`).\nThe problem requires us to **exclude** those empty strings from the final\nresult.\n\nThe algorithm is therefore straightforward:\n\n1. Initialise an empty list `result`.\n2. For each `w` in `words`  \n    a. Call `w.split(separator)` → list of parts.  \n    b. Extend `result` with all non‑empty parts (`part != ''`).\n3.

Removing the elements equal to `''`\ndoes not change the relative order of the remaining elements, and only those\nthat are empty are discarded. ∎\n\n*Theorem.* The algorithm returns a list containing all non‑empty substrings\nobtained by splitting each word in `words` by `separator`, in the order they\nappear in the original input.\n\n*Proof.* Consider an arbitrary word `w` in `words`. By Lemma 2, after step 2b\nthe algorithm has appended to `result` exactly the non‑empty substrings of `w`,\nin the correct order. Since the algorithm processes the words sequentially,\nthe substrings from earlier words appear earlier in `result` than those from\nlater words.

The empty prefix needs zero substrings, which is optimal.\nNo other value is possible, so the statement holds.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement true for all lengths `< i`.  \nConsider any optimal partition of prefix `s[0…i‑1]`. Let the **last** piece be\n`sub = s[j:i]` (so `0 ≤ j < i`). By definition of a partition, the part before\n`j` (`s[0…j‑1]`) is also partitioned optimally, otherwise the whole partition\nwould not be optimal. Hence the optimal number of pieces for the prefix is\n\n```\noptimal(i) = optimal(j) + 1\n```\n\nwhere `optimal(j) = dp[j]` by induction hypothesis, and `sub` is beautiful.\nDuring the DP transition the algorithm examines exactly this pair `(j,i)`,\nrecognises `sub` as beautiful (Lemma 1) and tries to set\n\n```\ndp[i] ≤ dp[j] + 1 = optimal(j) + 1 = optimal(i)\n```\n\nThus `dp[i]` is **at most** the optimal value.\n\nConversely, any value assigned to `dp[i]` comes from some `j` with a beautiful\n`sub = s[j:i]` and equals `dp[j] + 1`. By induction hypothesis `dp[j]` is the\nminimum possible for the prefix ending at `j`, therefore `dp[j] + 1` is a\nvalid number of pieces for the whole prefix. Hence `dp[i]` can never be smaller\nthan the optimum.\n\nBoth directions give `dp[i] = optimal(i)`.

The algorithm updates `bad_left` with the maximum of\nits current value and this start. No other updates are performed.\nThus after handling all occurrences ending at `i`, `bad_left` is the maximum\nover starts of occurrences ending at `i` **or earlier** (induction on `i`). ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor every position `i` the substring `word[bad_left+1 … i]` is valid\n(i.e. contains no forbidden word).\n\n**Proof.**  \nAssume the contrary: some forbidden occurrence `p` lies completely inside\n`word[bad_left+1 … i]`. Then `p` ends at some `e ≤ i` and starts at\n`start(p) ≥ bad_left+1`.

Hence `s > bad_left` and its length `i-s+1 ≤ i-bad_left`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor each `i` the algorithm computes `cur_len = i - bad_left`,\nwhich is exactly the maximum length of a valid substring ending at `i`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the substring `word[bad_left+1 … i]` is valid and has length\n`i - bad_left`. By Lemma&nbsp;3 no longer valid substring ending at `i`\nexists. Therefore `cur_len` equals the optimum for this `i`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the length of the longest valid substring of `word`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm keeps `ans = max_i cur_len`.  \nFrom Lemma&nbsp;4 each `cur_len` is the optimal length for substrings ending at\n`i`.

By Lemma 2 this first element is the smallest\nASCII value among the unused vowels, which are precisely the vowels belonging to\npositions `j ≥ i` (because all earlier vowel positions have already consumed the\nfirst elements of `V`). ∎\n\n\n\n*Theorem*  \nThe string `t` produced by the algorithm satisfies both required properties:\n\n1. Every consonant stays at its original index.\n2. The vowels appear in non‑decreasing ASCII order.\n\n*Proof.*  \n\n1. For any index `i` where `s[i]` is a consonant, step 3 copies `s[i]` directly\n   into the answer, never altering it. Hence `t[i] = s[i]`.\n\n2. Consider any two vowel indices `i < j`.  \n   When the algorithm processes `i` it writes the smallest remaining vowel\n   (Lemma 3). When later processing `j` it writes the smallest vowel among the\n   still‑unused ones, which cannot be smaller than the one already written at `i`\n   (otherwise it would have been taken earlier). Therefore `t[i] ≤ t[j]` in ASCII\n   order for all vowel pairs, i.e. the vowel subsequence of `t` is sorted\n   non‑decreasingly.\n\nBoth conditions hold, so `t` is a valid answer. ∎\n\n\n\n---\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\n* First scan (collect vowels): `O(n)` time, `O(k)` extra space (`k` = number of vowels).  \n* Sorting the vowel list: `O(k log k)` time, `O(k)` space.  \n* Second scan (build result): `O(n)` time, `O(n)` space for the output string.\n\nSince `k ≤ n`, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` in the worst case\n(all characters are vowels) and `O(n)` when there are few vowels.  \nThe additional memory usage is `O(n)` for the output plus `O(k)` for the vowel list,\nboth within the limits (`n ≤ 10⁵`).\n\n---\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def sortVowels(self, s: str) -> str:\n        # set of vowel characters (both cases)\n        vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')\n\n        # 1) collect all vowels\n        vowel_list = [ch for ch in s if ch in vowels]\n\n        # 2) sort them by ASCII value\n        vowel_list.sort()\n\n        # 3) rebuild the answer\n        res_chars = []\n        idx = 0                     # index in the sorted vowel list\n        for ch in s:\n            if ch in vowels:\n                # take the next smallest vowel\n                res_chars.append(vowel_list[idx])\n                idx += 1\n            else:\n                # consonant stays unchanged\n                res_chars.append(ch)\n\n        return ''.join(res_chars)\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms to the\nrequired function signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 100.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 1.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"execution time\": 0.034104347229003906}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 68, "group_id": 68, "sample_metadata": null}}

We consider an array good if it is a permutation of an array base[n].\nbase[n] = [1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n] (in other words, it is an array of length n + 1 which contains 1 to n - 1 exactly once, plus two occurrences of n). For example, base[1] = [1, 1] and base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3].\nReturn true if the given array is good, otherwise return false.\nNote: A permutation of integers represents an arrangement of these numbers.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2, 1, 3]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. However, base[3] has four elements but array nums has three. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]. So the answer is false.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1, 3, 3, 2]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3] (by swapping the second and fourth elements in nums, we reach base[3]). Therefore, the answer is true.\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1, 1]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 1, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 1. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[1] = [1, 1]. Therefore, the answer is true.\nExample 4:\n\nInput: nums = [3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 4, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 4. However, base[4] has five elements but array nums has six. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[4] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4].

A permutation does\nnot change length or maximum. ∎\n\n\n\n*Lemma 2*  \nIf the algorithm returns `True`, then `nums` satisfies the three conditions\nlisted above.\n\n*Proof.*  \n- The first `if` guarantees `len(nums) = m+1`.  \n- The loop over `freq` checks:\n  * any element equal to `m` occurs twice,\n  * any element between `1` and `m‑1` occurs once,\n  * no element outside `[1,m]` occurs.\n- The second loop ensures that every integer `1…m‑1` actually appears (otherwise\n  the earlier loop would have missed it).  \n\nThus all three conditions hold. ∎\n\n\n\n*Lemma 3*  \nIf `nums` satisfies the three conditions, the algorithm returns `True`.\n\n*Proof.*  \nGiven the conditions:\n- `len(nums) = m+1` ⇒ the first `if` passes.\n- The frequency of each value matches exactly what the loop checks, so the\n  loop never returns `False`.\n- Because every integer `1…m‑1` appears, the second loop also never returns\n  `False`.  \nConsequently the function reaches the final `return True`. ∎\n\n\n\n*Theorem*  \nThe algorithm returns `True` **iff** `nums` is a permutation of `base[n]` for\nsome `n`.\n\n*Proof.*  \n*If* part: Assume `nums` is a permutation of `base[n]`. By Lemma&nbsp;1,\n`len(nums)=n+1` and `max(nums)=n`. The multiset of elements of `base[n]`\nexactly matches the three conditions, therefore by Lemma&nbsp;3 the algorithm\nreturns `True`.\n\n*Only‑if* part: Assume the algorithm returns `True`. By Lemma&nbsp;2 the three\nconditions hold with `m = max(nums)`. Construct `base[m]`; it contains each\n`1…m‑1` once and `m` twice, exactly the multiset we have in `nums`.

The statement holds for `i = 1`.\n\n*Induction step*: assume the statement true before handling index `i`.  \nWhen `dp[i]` is computed we possibly improve `best[p]` by `max(best[p], dp[i])`.  \nThus after the update `best[p]` is the maximum of all `dp[j]` with `j ≤ i`\nand parity `p`. For the other parity the set of considered `j` does not change.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor every index `i (i > 0)` the algorithm computes  \n\n```\ndp[i] = max_{j < i} ( dp[j] – cost(j → i) ) + nums[i] .\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \nLet `p = parity(nums[i])`.  \nAll candidates `j < i` belong to one of two groups:\n\n* `parity(nums[j]) = p` → cost `0`.  \n  The best `dp[j]` among them is exactly `best[p]` by Lemma&nbsp;1.\n* `parity(nums[j]) ≠ p` → cost `x`.  \n  The best `dp[j]` among them is `best[1-p]` (Lemma&nbsp;1), and after subtracting\n  `x` we obtain `best[1-p] - x`.\n\nTaking the larger of the two gives the optimal predecessor value,\nand adding `nums[i]` yields the formula used by the algorithm. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every index `i` the value `dp[i]` produced by the algorithm equals the\nmaximum possible score of any valid walk that ends at `i`.\n\n**Proof.** By induction on `i`.\n\n*Base (`i = 0`)*: `dp[0] = nums[0]` is the only possible walk, thus optimal.\n\n*Induction step*: assume the claim true for all positions `< i`.  \nAny walk ending at `i` must come from some earlier `j`. Its score equals  \n\n```\n(score of optimal walk ending at j) + nums[i] – cost(j → i)\n      = dp[j] + nums[i] – cost(j → i)          (induction hypothesis)\n```\n\nThe best such walk is `max_{j < i} (dp[j] – cost(j → i)) + nums[i]`,\nwhich equals `dp[i]` by Lemma&nbsp;2. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nAfter processing the whole array, `max(best[0], best[1])` equals the maximum\nscore over **all** valid walks (ending anywhere).\n\n**Proof.** By Lemma&nbsp;1, after the last index `n‑1` is processed,\n`best[0]` (resp. `best[1]`) is the maximum `dp[i]` among even (resp. odd) ending\npositions. The overall optimum is the maximum over both parities,\ni.e. `max(best[0], best[1])`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`Solution.maxScore` returns the maximum total score achievable under the\ngiven rules.\n\n**Proof.** The algorithm computes `dp[i]` for every index `i`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 each `dp[i]` is the optimal score of a walk ending at `i`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the returned value is the maximum among all those optimal\nscores, therefore it is the optimal score among **all** possible walks. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

When a new number `x` belonging to `d` is seen:\n- if `x > first`, we shift `first` to `second` and set `first = x`;\n- else if `x > second`, we set `second = x`.\nThis is the classic “keep top‑2” update and after processing all numbers\n`first` and `second` are the two largest elements of the group. ∎\n\n*Lemma 3*  \nIf a valid pair exists, the algorithm computes the sum of the best pair for each digit.\n\n*Proof.*  \nBy Lemma 2 the stored `first` and `second` for digit `d` are the two largest numbers\nwith that digit. By Lemma 1 their sum is the maximum sum achievable among all pairs\nwith digit `d`. The algorithm adds this sum to the candidate set. ∎\n\n*Theorem*  \nThe algorithm returns the maximum sum of a pair of numbers whose maximum digits are equal,\nor `-1` if no such pair exists.\n\n*Proof.*  \nConsider all digits `d` that have at least two numbers.\nFor each such `d`, by Lemma 3 the algorithm evaluates the optimal sum for that digit.\nThe overall answer is the maximum over these optimal sums, which is exactly the\nmaximum sum over **all** valid pairs.  \nIf no digit has two numbers, the set of candidates is empty and the algorithm returns `-1`,\nwhich matches the problem specification. ∎\n\n---\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\n- Computing the maximum digit of a number takes `O(number of digits) ≤ O(5)` (since `nums[i] ≤ 10⁴`).  \n- Scanning the array once: `O(n)` time.  \n- Constant extra memory: an array of size 10 storing two integers each.\n\nOverall: **Time = O(n)**, **Space = O(1)**.\n\n---\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # top two numbers for each possible max digit (0-9)\n        # each entry is a list [first_max, second_max]\n        best = [[-1, -1] for _ in range(10)]\n\n        def max_digit(x: int) -> int:\n            \"\"\"return the largest decimal digit of x (x >= 1)\"\"\"\n            m = 0\n            while x:\n                d = x % 10\n                if d > m:\n                    m = d\n                x //= 10\n            return m\n\n        for num in nums:\n            d = max_digit(num)          # digit that groups this number\n            first, second = best[d]\n\n            if num > first:\n                # shift current first to second\n                best[d][1] = first\n                best[d][0] = num\n            elif num > second:\n                best[d][1] = num\n\n        answer = -1\n        for first, second in best:\n            if second != -1:            # we have at least two numbers\n                answer = max(answer, first + second)\n\n        return answer\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms to the required\nfunction signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 100.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 1.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"execution time\": 0.0007724761962890625}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 73, "group_id": 73, "sample_metadata": null}}

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible number of seconds.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nAfter `t` seconds a position `i` can hold a value `v` **iff**\nthere exists an original index `j` with `nums[j]=v` and\n`circular_distance(i , j) ≤ t`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*If*: Starting from `j`, in each second the value can move one step left or\nright, therefore after `t` seconds it can reach any position at distance ≤ `t`.  \n\n*Only‑if*: In one second a value can move at most one step, so after `t` seconds\nits distance from the original position cannot exceed `t`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed value `v` let `t(v) = max_gap // 2` where `max_gap` is the largest\ncircular gap between two consecutive occurrences of `v`.  \nThen after `t(v)` seconds every array element can become `v`, and it is impossible\nin fewer than `t(v)` seconds.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider any gap of length `g`. The farthest index inside this gap from both\nends is at distance `⌊g/2⌋`. Hence the maximal distance of any index to the\nnearest occurrence of `v` equals `max_gap // 2 = t(v)`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 each index can obtain `v` exactly when the waiting time is at\nleast its distance to the nearest original `v`. Consequently `t(v)` seconds are\nsufficient for the whole array.\n\nIf we wait `< t(v)` seconds, the index that lies in the middle of the maximal\ngap has distance `t(v) > waiting_time` from any original `v`, thus by Lemma&nbsp;1\nit cannot become `v`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every value `v` the algorithm computes `t(v)`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm enumerates all gaps between consecutive positions of `v`,\nincluding the wrap‑around gap, stores the maximum as `max_gap` and returns\n`max_gap // 2`. This is exactly the definition of `t(v)` from Lemma&nbsp;2. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nLet `ans` be the number returned by the algorithm.\nThere exists a sequence of operations that equalises the whole array in `ans`\nseconds.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`ans = min_v t(v)` by the algorithm. Choose a value `v*` attaining this minimum.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the whole array can be turned into `v*` in `t(v*) = ans` seconds. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nNo sequence of operations can equalise the array in fewer than `ans` seconds.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAssume a faster solution exists, finishing in `s < ans` seconds with final value\n`u`. By Lemma&nbsp;2 we must have `s ≥ t(u)`. Because `ans` is the minimum of all\n`t(v)`, `t(u) ≥ ans`. Hence `s ≥ ans`, contradicting `s < ans`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the minimum possible number of seconds needed to make all\nelements of `nums` equal.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFrom Lemma&nbsp;4 a schedule of length `ans` seconds exists.\nFrom Lemma&nbsp;5 no shorter schedule exists.\nTherefore `ans` is exactly the optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

If `started` is false we have built no\nnumber, which must not be counted. The definition of the base case matches\nthis, so the lemma holds.\n\n*Induction step.* Assume the lemma true for `pos+1`.  \nAll possible digits `d` respecting the current `tight` are enumerated.\nThe four cases in the transition are exhaustive:\n\n* `started = false, d = 0` – we stay in the leading‑zero zone, `prev` stays\n  “none”, `started` stays false, `tight` updates correctly.\n* `started = false, d > 0` – we start the number, `prev` becomes `d`,\n  `started` becomes true, adjacency condition is irrelevant for the first\n  digit.\n* `started = true` – we may place `d` only if `|d‑prev| = 1`; then `prev`\n  updates to `d`, `started` stays true.\n\nIn each sub‑case the recursive call counts exactly the valid completions of\nthe suffix (induction hypothesis). Summation over all admissible `d`\ntherefore yields precisely the number of valid completions for the current\nstate. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \n`count_up_to(S)` (the value returned by the DP for bound `S`) equals `F(S)`,\nthe number of stepping numbers `≤ S`.\n\n*Proof.*  \n`count_up_to` invokes `dp(0, 10, True, False)`.  \nAt position `0` no digit has been placed, the prefix is empty, therefore it\nis equal to the bound’s prefix (`tight = True`) and the number has not started.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 this call counts exactly all ways to fill the whole string\nwith digits that satisfy the stepping property, have no leading zero and do\nnot exceed `S`. Those ways are in one‑to‑one correspondence with the stepping\nnumbers `≤ S`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor any positive integer `L`, `count_up_to(L‑1)` equals the number of stepping\nnumbers **strictly smaller** than `L`.\n\n*Proof.*  \n`L‑1` is the greatest integer `< L`.

Therefore the condition matches the definition exactly. ∎\n\n\n\n*Lemma 3*  \n`max_sum` is always the maximum sum among all almost‑unique windows examined so far.\n\n*Proof.*  \n`max_sum` is initialized to `0`.  \nWhenever a window is almost unique (Lemma&nbsp;2) we set  \n`max_sum = max(max_sum, cur_sum)`.  \nThus after processing a window, `max_sum` is the maximum of its previous value and the sum of the newly examined almost‑unique window. By induction over the processed windows, the invariant holds. ∎\n\n\n\n*Theorem*  \nThe algorithm returns the maximum sum of any almost‑unique subarray of length `k`. If none exists it returns `0`.\n\n*Proof.*  \nAll length‑`k` subarrays appear exactly once as the sliding window moves from the start to the end of `nums`. By Lemma&nbsp;2 each almost‑unique subarray is recognized, and by Lemma&nbsp;3 `max_sum` becomes the maximum sum among all those recognized windows.

By definition, `s` equals the concatenation of the first characters of all words in order. By the Lemma, `first_chars` contains exactly those characters, so `acronym = ''.join(first_chars)` equals `s`.

Both statements hold.\n\n*Induction step*: assume the lemma true for a prefix `P`.\nWhen we append a digit `d`:\n\n* If we are still in leading zeros (`new_started = False`) the real prefix\n  does not change, and the DP keeps `diff` and `rem` unchanged (or `rem = 0`),\n  preserving the invariant.\n* Otherwise `new_started = True`.  \n  - `new_diff = diff + 1` if `d` is even, else `diff - 1`.  \n    This exactly adds `+1` to `evenCnt` or `-1` to `oddCnt`, therefore\n    `new_diff = evenCnt(P·d) – oddCnt(P·d)`.  \n  - `new_rem = (rem·10 + d) % k` is the usual way to update a remainder,\n    hence `new_rem = value(P·d) mod k`.\n\nThus the invariant holds for the longer prefix. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nWhen the DP reaches `pos == len(digits)` (all positions processed),\nit returns `1` **iff** the constructed number `N` satisfies both\nbeauty conditions (1) and (2).\n\n**Proof.** At that moment `started` is true exactly when at least one\nnon‑zero digit has been placed, i.e. `N > 0`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1, `diff = evenCnt(N) – oddCnt(N)` and `rem = N mod k`.  \nThe DP returns `1` only when `started` is true, `diff == 0` and `rem == 0`,\nwhich is precisely conditions (1) and (2). ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \n`count_upto(x)` equals the number of beautiful integers `n` with `1 ≤ n ≤ x`.\n\n**Proof.** The DP enumerates **all** digit sequences of length `len(x)`\nthat are ≤ `x` (the `tight` flag guarantees the prefix never exceeds the\ncorresponding prefix of `x`).  \nEach sequence corresponds to exactly one integer `n` (ignoring leading zeros).\nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the DP adds `1` for a sequence **iff** the integer `n`\nis beautiful. Therefore the total returned by `count_upto` is exactly the\ndesired count. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor any `low ≤ high`  \n\n```\nanswer = count_upto(high) - count_upto(low-1)\n```\n\nequals the number of beautiful integers in `[low , high]`.\n\n**Proof.** `count_upto(high)` counts beautiful numbers `≤ high`.  \n`count_upto(low-1)` counts beautiful numbers `< low`.  \nSubtracting removes those below `low` and leaves precisely the numbers\n`low ≤ n ≤ high`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`Solution.numberOfBeautifulIntegers(low, high, k)` returns the exact number\nof beautiful integers in the interval `[low, high]`.\n\n**Proof.** The method computes `count_upto(high)` and `count_upto(low-1)`\nusing the DP described above and returns their difference.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 each `count_upto` is correct, and by Lemma&nbsp;4 their\ndifference is exactly the required quantity. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

One of them will be used for the current bit, the rest stay in the\nmultiset for later use.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Greedy processing from low bits to high bits  \n\nWe keep an array `cnt[0…30]` – how many elements of value `2^k` we currently\nhave (including those produced by previous splits).\n\nWe walk through the bits from low to high (`i = 0 … 30`).\n\n*If the current bit of `target` is 0* – nothing is required, we only\npropagate possible pairs of `2^i` upwards:\n\n```\ncnt[i+1] += cnt[i] // 2          # two 2^i could have been a 2^{i+1}\n```\n\n*If the current bit of `target` is 1* – we need one `2^i`.\n\n```\nif cnt[i] > 0:                     # we already own it\n        cnt[i] -= 1                # use it\nelse:                              # we must create it\n        find the smallest j > i with cnt[j] > 0\n        if such j does not exist → impossible → return -1\n        while j > i:               # split step by step\n                cnt[j] -= 1\n                cnt[j-1] += 2      # one split creates two halves\n                operations += 1\n                j -= 1\n        cnt[i] -= 1                # use one of the newly created 2^i\n```\n\nAfter satisfying the need we again propagate pairs upwards exactly as in the\n`need[i]==0` case.\n\nWhy is this greedy optimal?\n\n* We always use an already existing `2^i` if possible – never waste a larger\n  element when a smaller one suffices.\n* When we have to create a missing `2^i` we take the **nearest larger**\n  element (`j` minimal). Any solution that uses a larger `j' > j` would need\n  at least `j'-i ≥ j-i+1` extra splits, therefore cannot be better.\n* Propagating pairs upwards does not change the number of operations; it only\n  records that two equal small elements could have originated from a larger\n  one, which may be useful for future bits.\n\nThus the described algorithm yields the minimum possible number of splits.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum number of operations or `-1`\nif impossible.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nWhen processing bit `i`, if `cnt[i] > 0` the algorithm can safely use one\n`2^i` without increasing the optimal number of operations.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAny feasible solution must provide a `2^i` for this bit. Using an already\navailable `2^i` costs `0` operations, while any alternative (splitting a\nlarger element) costs at least one operation. Therefore using the existing\nelement is never worse. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf `cnt[i] = 0` while processing bit `i`, any feasible solution must split\nsome element `2^j` with `j > i`. Let `j*` be the smallest index with\n`cnt[j*] > 0`. Any optimal solution splits an element of size `2^{j*}` and\nneeds exactly `j*‑i` operations for this bit.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll elements larger than `2^{j*}` are also present (otherwise `j*` would not be\nminimal). Splitting a `2^{j}` with `j > j*` needs at least `j‑i ≥ j*‑i+1`\noperations, strictly more than splitting `2^{j*}`.  \nConversely, splitting one `2^{j*}` repeatedly down to `2^i` indeed creates a\n`2^i` and costs exactly `j*‑i` operations, which is achievable. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nAfter finishing the handling of bit `i` (including the propagation\n`cnt[i+1] += cnt[i] // 2`) the multiset `cnt` correctly represents **all**\nelements that can be present after any sequence of operations that uses the\nminimum possible number of splits for bits `0 … i`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nInduction over `i`.\n\n*Base (`i = -1`).*  Before any processing `cnt` equals the original array,\nwhich is obviously correct.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement holds after bit `i‑1`.  \nWhen processing bit `i` the algorithm either\n\n* uses an existing `2^i` (Lemma&nbsp;1) – the multiset after removal is still\n  reachable with the same minimal number of operations, or\n* creates a `2^i` by splitting the smallest possible larger element\n  (Lemma&nbsp;2) – this is the cheapest way to obtain the needed `2^i`,\n  therefore any optimal solution must perform exactly the same splits.\n  The algorithm updates `cnt` exactly according to those splits, so the new\n  `cnt` again describes a multiset reachable with the minimal number of\n  operations for bits `0 … i`.\n\nFinally the propagation `cnt[i+1] += cnt[i] // 2` merely records that two\nidentical `2^i` could have originated from a `2^{i+1}`; this does not affect\nreachability nor the optimality of the already performed operations.\nThus the invariant holds for `i`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf the algorithm returns `-1`, no sequence of operations can produce a\nsubsequence summing to `target`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm returns `-1` only when, for some required bit `i`, there is no\nlarger power present (`cnt[j] = 0` for all `j > i`).

Starting with an odd number we can never reach\nzero mismatches. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor any two mismatching positions `a < b` the cheapest way to fix them\n(independently of the other positions) costs `min(x , b-a)`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*Using operation 1* directly costs `x`.  \n*Using only operation 2* we can flip the segment `[a , b]` with `b-a`\nadjacent flips, as described in Observation 2, costing `b-a`.  \nNo other sequence can be cheaper because every operation flips two bits,\nso at least one operation is necessary and each operation costs at least\n`1`. Hence the minimum of the two possibilities is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThere exists an optimal solution in which every operation pairs two\n**adjacent** mismatches in the sorted list `diff`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake any optimal solution and look at the set of pairs of mismatching\nindices it creates. Suppose a pair `{i , j}` is not adjacent in `diff`,\ni.e. there is another mismatching index `p` with `i < p < j`.  \nBecause the cost function `c(u,v)=min(x, v-u)` is non‑decreasing with the\ndistance, we have  \n\n```\nc(i , j) + c(p , q)  ≥  c(i , p) + c(j , q)\n```\n\nwhere `{p , q}` is the partner of `p` in the solution (if `p` is paired\nwith `j` we simply swap the partners).  \nReplacing the two crossing pairs by the two non‑crossing pairs never\nincreases the total cost. Repeating this operation eliminates all crossings,\nyielding a solution where each pair consists of consecutive elements of\n`diff`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor every even `k = |diff|` the cost computed by the algorithm equals the\nminimum possible total cost.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 we may restrict attention to solutions that pair\nconsecutive mismatches.  \nFor each such pair `{diff[2t] , diff[2t+1]}` the cheapest way to fix it is,\nby Lemma&nbsp;2, `min(x , diff[2t+1] - diff[2t])`.  \nThe algorithm sums exactly these independent minima, therefore its total\ncost is achievable and no solution can be cheaper. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minOperations` returns  \n\n* `-1` iff it is impossible to make `s1` equal to `s2`;\n* otherwise the minimum possible total cost.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If `|diff|` is odd* – by Lemma 1 the task is impossible, the algorithm\nreturns `-1`.\n\n*If `|diff|` is even* – Lemma 4 shows that the algorithm’s sum is both\nachievable and optimal, hence the returned value is the minimum cost. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Square‑free kernel  \n\nWrite a number `x` as  \n\n```\nx = (product of primes with odd exponent)  *  (some integer)²\n```\n\nThe first factor is called the **square‑free kernel** of `x` and we denote it\nby `k(x)`.  \nExample  \n\n```\nx = 72 = 2³ * 3²          →  k(x) = 2          (because 2 appears odd times)\nx = 45 = 3² * 5¹          →  k(x) = 5\nx = 36 = 2² * 3²          →  k(x) = 1\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.   When is a product a perfect square ?\n\nTake two numbers `a , b`.\n\n```\na = k(a) * p²\nb = k(b) * q²\na·b = k(a)·k(b) * (p·q)²\n```\n\n`(p·q)²` is already a square.  \nTherefore `a·b` is a perfect square **iff** `k(a)·k(b)` is a perfect square.\n\n`k(a)` and `k(b)` are square‑free, i.e. every prime occurs at most once.\nThe product of two square‑free numbers is a square **iff the two numbers are\nidentical** (otherwise some prime would appear only once).\n\n```\na·b is a perfect square   ⇔   k(a) = k(b)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Consequence for a complete subset  \n\nAll elements of a complete subset must share the same kernel.\nConversely, if a set of numbers has the same kernel, any pair multiplies to a\nsquare, so the whole set is complete.\n\nHence the problem reduces to:\n\n*Group the array by `k(x)`.  \nFor each group compute the sum of its elements.  \nThe answer is the maximum group sum (a single element is also a group).*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Computing the kernel  \n\n`nums[i] ≤ 10⁹`.  \nWe factor each number by trial division using all primes up to `√10⁹ ≈ 31623`.\nThe amount of primes ≤ 31623 is only 3401, so the total work is well below the\nlimit (`n ≤ 10⁴`).\n\nAlgorithm for one number `v` :\n\n```\nkernel = 1\nfor each prime p (p·p ≤ v):\n        cnt = 0\n        while v % p == 0:\n                v //= p\n                cnt ^= 1          # keep only parity\n        if cnt == 1:               # odd exponent\n                kernel *= p\nif v > 1:                         # remaining prime factor with exponent 1\n        kernel *= v\nreturn kernel\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible element‑sum of a\ncomplete subset.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any two integers `a , b` :\n\n`a·b` is a perfect square **iff** `k(a) = k(b)`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWrite `a = k(a)·p² , b = k(b)·q²`.  \nThen `a·b = k(a)·k(b)·(p·q)²`.  \nThe factor `(p·q)²` is a square.  \n`k(a)·k(b)` is square‑free; a square‑free number is a perfect square only when\nit equals `1`.  \nThus `k(a)·k(b)` is a square ⇔ `k(a)·k(b) = 1` ⇔ `k(a) = k(b)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nA subset `T` of indices is complete **iff** all numbers `nums[i]` with\n`i ∈ T` have the same kernel.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*If* all kernels are equal, by Lemma&nbsp;1 any pair multiplies to a square,\nhence `T` is complete.  \n*Only‑if*: assume `T` is complete. Take any two indices `i , j ∈ T`. Their\nproduct is a square, therefore by Lemma&nbsp;1 `k(nums[i]) = k(nums[j])`.  \nThus all kernels are identical. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a fixed kernel value `c`, the subset consisting of **all** array elements\nwith kernel `c` is complete and has the maximum possible sum among all\ncomplete subsets whose elements have kernel `c`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 any subset with kernel `c` is complete, so the whole set of\nthose elements is also complete. Adding any element with the same kernel can\nonly increase the sum, therefore the full group yields the maximal sum for\nkernel `c`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the maximum element‑sum of any complete subset of the\ngiven array.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n1. The algorithm computes `k(x)` for every array element and groups the\n   elements by this value.\n2. For each group it computes the sum of **all** its elements.\n   By Lemma&nbsp;3 this sum is the largest achievable sum among complete\n   subsets that use this kernel.\n3. Any complete subset belongs to exactly one group (Lemma&nbsp;2), therefore\n   its sum cannot exceed the sum of that group.\n4. The algorithm returns the maximum over all group sums, which is at least\n   as large as any complete subset sum and is itself attainable (by taking the\n   whole corresponding group).\n\nHence the returned value is exactly the optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.   Complexity Analysis  \n\n*Let* `P` be the number of primes ≤ 31623 (`P = 3401`).\n\n- Sieve: `O(31623 log log 31623)` ≈ `O(31623)`.\n- Kernel computation for one number: at most `P` divisions, but the loop stops\n  when `p·p > current value`. In the worst case (`v` is prime) we test all\n  primes up to √v, i.e. `O(P)`.  \n  For `n ≤ 10⁴` total `O(n·P) ≈ 3.4·10⁷` elementary operations – easily fast.\n- Grouping and finding the maximum: `O(n)`.\n\nOverall time `O(n·√max(nums[i]) / log √max)` ≈ `O(n·P)` and memory `O(n)` for\nthe hash map.\n\nBoth satisfy the constraints.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.

Keeping only the needed candidates  \n\nFor a fixed right end `i` we have to examine **all** `j`.  \nBecause the number of different `AND(j,i)` values is tiny we can keep,\nfor each possible AND value, the *best* prefix `dp[j‑1]` that produces it.\n\n```\nprev[and] = (bestPrefixScore , bestPrefixParts)\n```\n\n`prev` contains the information for subarrays that end at `i‑1`.\nFrom it we build the information for subarrays that end at `i`.\n\n* start a new subarray at `i`  \n  `and = nums[i]` , prefix = `dp[i‑1]`\n* extend every subarray represented in `prev`  \n  newAnd = oldAnd & nums[i] , same prefix as before\n\nFor each produced `newAnd` we compute the **total** result for the whole\nprefix `0 … i`\n\n```\ntotalScore = prefixScore + newAnd\ntotalParts = prefixParts + 1\n```\n\nand keep the best `(totalScore , totalParts)` for this `newAnd`.\n\nAfter processing all possibilities the best among the stored `newAnd`s is\nexactly `dp[i]`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Updating `prev` for the next iteration  \n\nFor the next index we again need, for every possible AND value of a suffix\nending at the current position, the *best* prefix **before** the suffix\nstarts.\n\nFrom a stored entry\n\n```\ntotalScore = prefixScore + and\ntotalParts = prefixParts + 1\n```\n\nwe recover the prefix information:\n\n```\nprefixScore = totalScore - and\nprefixParts = totalParts - 1\n```\n\nThese pairs become the new `prev`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the required maximum number of subarrays.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed right end `i` the dictionary `cur` built by the algorithm\ncontains, for every possible AND value `v` of a subarray ending at `i`,\nthe pair `(bestScore , bestParts)` where  \n\n* `bestScore` is the minimal total score of a split of the prefix `0 … i`\n  whose **last** part has AND `v`,\n* `bestParts` is the maximal number of parts among all splits that achieve\n  `bestScore` and end with a part of AND `v`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll subarrays ending at `i` are of two kinds:\n\n1. **Length 1** – start at `i`.  \n   The algorithm creates the candidate using the optimal split of the\n   prefix `0 … i‑1` (`dp[i‑1]`). This candidate is exactly the split whose\n   last part is `[i,i]`.\n\n2. **Extended** – obtained by taking a subarray `[j … i‑1]` (already\n   represented in `prev`) and appending `nums[i]`.  \n   `prev` stores for the AND of `[j … i‑1]` the best possible prefix\n   `dp[j‑1]`. Adding `nums[i]` yields the AND of `[j … i]` and the total\n   score `dp[j‑1].score + (oldAnd & nums[i])`.  \n   Hence the algorithm creates the optimal split for every possible start\n   `j`.\n\nFor each resulting AND value `v` the algorithm keeps the candidate with the\nsmallest total score, breaking ties by the larger number of parts.\nTherefore the stored pair satisfies the statement. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \n`dp[i]` computed by the algorithm equals the optimal pair\n`(minScore_i , maxParts_i)` for the prefix `0 … i`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1, for every possible AND value `v` of a last part,\n`cur[v]` is the best split of the whole prefix whose last part has AND `v`.\nThe overall optimal split of the prefix must end with *some* AND value `v`,\nhence its total score and number of parts appear among the values of `cur`.\nThe algorithm selects the smallest score, breaking ties with the larger\nnumber of parts, exactly the definition of `(minScore_i , maxParts_i)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe dictionary `prev` prepared for the next iteration contains, for each\nAND value `v` of a suffix ending at the current index `i`,\nthe best possible pair `(prefixScore , prefixParts)` where the prefix is\nthe part of the array **before** that suffix starts.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`cur[v]` stores `totalScore = prefixScore + v` and\n`totalParts = prefixParts + 1`.  \nSubtracting `v` and `1` recovers the prefix information.\nIf several suffixes have the same AND `v`, the algorithm keeps the one with\nthe smallest `prefixScore` (and, on a tie, the larger `prefixParts`), i.e.\nthe optimal prefix for that `v`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor every index `i` the algorithm examines **all** possible splits of the\nprefix `0 … i`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nInduction over `i`.\n\n*Base `i = 0`* – the only split is the single element subarray, which is\nexplicitly considered.\n\n*Induction step* – assume all splits of prefix `0 … i‑1` are examined.\nAny split of prefix `0 … i` ends with a subarray `[j … i]`.  \nThe prefix `0 … j‑1` is a split of a shorter prefix, therefore by the\ninduction hypothesis its optimal value is stored in `dp[j‑1]`.  \nWhen processing `i` the algorithm creates a candidate for `[j … i]`\nexactly from the entry in `prev` that corresponds to the AND of `[j … i‑1]`\ntogether with the stored optimal prefix `dp[j‑1]`.  \nThus every possible last part is generated, and consequently every split\nof the prefix is examined. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the maximum possible number of subarrays among all\nsplits whose total score is minimal.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFrom Lemma&nbsp;2, after the last iteration (`i = n‑1`) `dp[n‑1]` equals the\npair `(globalMinScore , maxParts)` where `globalMinScore` is the smallest\ntotal score achievable for the whole array and `maxParts` is the largest\nnumber of parts among splits attaining that score.  \nThe algorithm returns `maxParts`, which is exactly the required answer. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible length.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nDuring the scan, when `nums[i] < nums[j]` holds, pairing `i` with `j`\ndoes not reduce the maximum possible number of total pairs.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll elements left of `i` are already processed, all elements right of\n`j` are still unused.  \nBecause the array is sorted, any element that could be paired with\n`i` must be **≥** `nums[j]`. Using the *smallest* such element (`j`) leaves\nonly larger (or equal) candidates for the remaining left elements,\nwhich can only be *more* flexible. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf `nums[i] >= nums[j]` then `i` cannot be paired with any element at\nposition `< j`.  \n\n**Proof.**  \nAll positions `< j` are ≤ `j-1`. Since the array is sorted,\n`nums[j-1] ≤ nums[j] ≤ nums[i]`. Hence `nums[i]` is **not** strictly smaller\nthan any of them, so no valid pair exists with those indices. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe algorithm produces the maximum possible number of pairs.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider the execution of the algorithm.\n*If a pair is created* (`nums[i] < nums[j]`), by Lemma&nbsp;1 using this\npair cannot hurt optimality.\n*If no pair is created* (`nums[i] >= nums[j]`), Lemma&nbsp;2 shows that\n`i` cannot be matched with any element before `j`; the algorithm simply\nadvances `j` looking for a feasible partner. No optimal solution can\npair `i` with an earlier element, therefore skipping `j` does not lose\nany possible pair.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds until either all left elements are exhausted\nor no right element remains. In both cases no further pair can exist,\nhence the number of pairs found equals the optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`answer = n - 2·pairs` returned by the algorithm equals the minimum\npossible length of the array after any sequence of allowed operations.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFrom Lemma&nbsp;3, `pairs` is the largest achievable number of deletable\npairs. Each pair removes exactly two elements, so any sequence of\noperations can delete at most `2·pairs` elements. Consequently the\nremaining length is at least `n - 2·pairs`.  \nThe algorithm itself constructs a concrete sequence achieving exactly\n`pairs` deletions, therefore the length `n - 2·pairs` is attainable.\nThus it is the minimum possible length. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

The new number of operations is  \n\n```\na' + b' = (a - 3/2) + (b + 1) = a + b - 1/2 .\n```\n\nThus increasing `b` by one (while staying feasible) strictly reduces the\ntotal number of operations.

This means `c < 3` and `c` is odd (the only case is `c = 1`).\nIndeed, `c = 1` cannot be expressed as `2·a + 3·b` with non‑negative integers,\nso no combination of allowed deletions can remove a single element.\nAll other `c ≥ 2` have a feasible solution (by Lemma 2). ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor every value `v` with count `c = cnt(v)` that is feasible,\nthe algorithm returns the minimum possible number of operations needed\nto delete all occurrences of `v`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma 2 the algorithm finds the maximal feasible `b`.  \nBy Lemma 1 the solution using this `b` (and the corresponding `a`) minimises\n`a + b`. The algorithm outputs exactly this `a + b`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe method `minOperations` returns  \n\n* the minimum total number of operations required to delete the whole\n  array, if it is possible,  \n* `-1` otherwise.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If the method returns `-1`.*  \nThat happens only when some count `c` is declared impossible.\nBy Lemma 3 such a `c` cannot be expressed as `2·a + 3·b`, therefore no\nsequence of allowed deletions can remove all elements of that value,\nhence the whole array cannot be emptied.\n\n*If the method returns a non‑negative integer `ans`.*  \nFor each distinct value `v` the algorithm computes the optimal number of\noperations `opt(v)` (Lemma 4) and sums them:\n\n```\nans = Σ_v opt(v)\n```\n\nBecause operations on different values are independent, any valid global\nstrategy must perform at least `opt(v)` operations on each value `v`,\nso it needs at least `ans` operations in total.\nConversely, performing for every `v` the optimal groups found by the\nalgorithm (they are disjoint) empties the array using exactly `ans`\noperations. Hence `ans` is the global optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Because the\nselection size is `k`, we have `cntLess(k)=k`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm counts exactly the feasible `k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm iterates all `k = 0 … n`.  \nFor each `k` it checks `pref[k] == k` (which is `cntLess(k) == k`) and\n`freq[k] == 0`. By Lemma&nbsp;3 these two tests are true exactly for the\nfeasible `k`.

Hence `answer` is the optimum over **all**\nsub‑arrays. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minSizeSubarray` returns  \n\n* the length of the shortest sub‑array of `infinite_nums` whose sum equals\n  `target`, or\n* `-1` if no such sub‑array exists.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf a suitable sub‑array exists, Lemma 5 shows that `answer` holds its\nminimum length, and the method returns it.  \nIf no sub‑array exists, neither phase ever updates `answer`; it stays at\n`+∞` and the method returns `-1`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\n*Prefix sums & map* – `O(n)` time, `O(n)` extra memory.  \n*Sliding window on 2·n elements* – `O(n)` time, `O(1)` extra memory.  \n*Loop over start positions* – `O(n)` time, `O(1)` extra memory.  \n\nOverall  \n\n```\nTime   : O(n)      (n ≤ 10^5)\nMemory : O(n)\n```\n\nBoth satisfy the constraints.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Reference Implementation  (Python 3)\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minSizeSubarray(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n        n = len(nums)\n        total = sum(nums)                     # S\n        # ---------- prefix sums and map ----------\n        pref = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            pref[i] = pref[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]\n        pref_map = {pref[i]: i for i in range(n + 1)}   # value -> length\n\n        INF = 10 ** 18\n        ans = INF\n\n        # ---------- sub‑arrays with length <= 2n ----------\n        cur = 0\n        left = 0\n        # we walk over the virtual array nums+nums (length 2n)\n        for right in range(2 * n):\n            cur += nums[right % n]\n            while cur > target and left <= right:\n                cur -= nums[left % n]\n                left += 1\n            if cur == target:\n                ans = min(ans, right - left + 1)\n\n        # ---------- sub‑arrays that contain whole copies ----------\n        for i in range(n):                     # start index inside a copy\n            suffix_sum = total - pref[i]       # sum from i to end of copy\n            remaining = target - suffix_sum\n            if remaining < 0:\n                continue\n            k = remaining // total\n            rem = remaining % total\n            if rem in pref_map:                # a suitable prefix exists\n                length = (n - i) + k * n + pref_map[rem]\n                ans = min(ans, length)\n\n        return ans if ans != INF else -1\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms\nto the required function signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: invalid character '\\u2026' (U+2026) (<string>, line 38)\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 111, "group_id": 111, "sample_metadata": null}}

The inner loop iterates\nover all possible end indices `j` with `j ≥ i`. Hence each pair `(i, j)`\nwith `0 ≤ i ≤ j < n` appears once, which corresponds one‑to‑one to a\nsubstring `s[i … j]`. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 3**  \nWhenever the algorithm updates `best_len` and `best_sub`,\n`best_sub` is a beautiful substring of length `best_len`.\n\n*Proof.* An update happens only inside the `if pref[j+1]-pref[i]==k`\nbranch. By Lemma&nbsp;1 this condition means the current substring has exactly\n`k` ones, i.e. it is beautiful. The algorithm stores its length in\n`best_len` and the substring itself in `best_sub`. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 4**  \nAt any moment `best_len` is the smallest length among all beautiful\nsubstrings examined so far, and `best_sub` is the lexicographically smallest\nbeautiful substring of that length.\n\n*Proof.* Induction over the iterations.\n\n*Base*: before any iteration `best_len = INF`, the statement holds vacuously.\n\n*Induction step*: assume the statement holds before processing a new\nbeautiful substring `cur_sub` of length `cur_len`.\n\n* If `cur_len < best_len` we replace both variables, so the new `best_len`\n  is the smallest length seen, and `best_sub` is the only substring of that\n  length → trivially smallest lexicographically.\n\n* If `cur_len == best_len` we keep the smaller of `best_sub` and `cur_sub`,\n  preserving the smallest lexicographic order for that length.\n\n* If `cur_len > best_len` nothing changes, so the invariant stays true.\n\nThus the invariant holds after each iteration. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 5**  \nAfter the loops finish, `best_len` equals the length of the *shortest*\nbeautiful substring of `s`, and `best_sub` is the lexicographically smallest\nbeautiful substring of that length.\n\n*Proof.* By Lemma&nbsp;2 every substring has been examined, therefore the set of\nbeautiful substrings considered by the algorithm is exactly the set of all\nbeautiful substrings of `s`. Lemma&nbsp;4 tells us that after the last\niteration the stored pair satisfies the required optimality properties. ∎\n\n\n\n**Theorem**  \nThe algorithm returns\n\n* the lexicographically smallest beautiful substring of `s` whose length\n  equals the minimal possible length, or\n* the empty string if no beautiful substring exists.\n\n*Proof.* If at least one beautiful substring exists, Lemma&nbsp;5 guarantees\nthat `best_sub` is exactly the desired substring, which the algorithm\nreturns. If none exists, the update branch is never executed, `best_sub`\nremains `\"\"`, and the algorithm returns the empty string as required. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\n*Prefix sums*: `O(n)` time, `O(n)` extra space.  \n*Double loop*: `O(n²)` iterations, each `O(1)`.  \nOverall  \n\n* **Time**: `O(n²)` ≤ `10⁴` operations (n ≤ 100).  \n* **Memory**: `O(n)` for the prefix array (≤ 101 integers).\n\nBoth are easily within the limits.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestBeautifulSubstring(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        n = len(s)\n        # prefix sum of number of '1's\n        pref = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i, ch in enumerate(s):\n            pref[i + 1] = pref[i] + (ch == '1')\n\n        best_len = float('inf')\n        best_sub = \"\"\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i, n):\n                # number of '1's in s[i..j]\n                if pref[j + 1] - pref[i] == k:\n                    cur_len = j - i + 1\n                    cur_sub = s[i:j + 1]\n\n                    if cur_len < best_len:\n                        best_len = cur_len\n                        best_sub = cur_sub\n                    elif cur_len == best_len and cur_sub < best_sub:\n                        best_sub = cur_sub\n\n        return best_sub  # empty string if never updated\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms to\nthe required function signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: invalid character '\\u2026' (U+2026) (<string>, line 39)\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 112, "group_id": 112, "sample_metadata": null}}

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible sum of squares.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor every bit position `b` the total number of copies `cnt[b]` is invariant under\nthe allowed operation.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider one operation on numbers `x` and `y`.\n\n*If both have the bit*: `x&y` and `x|y` both have it → count unchanged.  \n*If exactly one has the bit*: after the operation the `|`‑side has it, the `&`‑side\ndoes not → still exactly one copy. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nAny final array can be described by assigning each of the `cnt[b]` copies of\nbit `b` to distinct array elements, with at most one copy of the same bit per\nelement.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBecause of Lemma&nbsp;1 the multiset of copies never changes.\nThe operation never creates a situation where an element contains the same bit\ntwice, and any redistribution respecting the “at most one per element” rule can\nbe achieved by a sequence of pairwise operations (standard constructive proof,\ne.g. repeatedly move a needed bit from a donor to a receiver using the operation). ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a fixed `k`, among all possible assignments of the bit copies to `k`\nnumbers, the greedy construction described in the algorithm yields the maximum\nvalue of `Σ_{i=1}^{k} a_i²`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nLet the greedy numbers be `g₁ ≥ g₂ ≥ … ≥ g_k` (they are non‑increasing because\n`cnt[b] > i` becomes false later).  \nTake any other feasible assignment producing numbers `p₁ ≥ p₂ ≥ … ≥ p_k`.\n\nConsider the largest index `t` where `g_t ≠ p_t`.  \nBecause both families use the same multiset of bit copies, there exists a bit\n`b` such that `g_t` contains `b` while `p_t` does not, and some earlier number\n`p_s` (`s < t`) contains `b` (otherwise the copy would be unused).  \nSwap this copy from `p_s` to `p_t` (possible because `p_t` does not have `b`\nyet). The total sum of squares changes by\n\n```\nΔ = (p_t + 2^b)² + (p_s - 2^b)² - p_t² - p_s²\n  = 2·2^b·(p_t - p_s) + 2·(2^b)²   > 0      (since p_t ≤ p_s)\n```\n\nThus the swap strictly increases the sum. Repeating swaps we can transform\n`p` into `g` while never decreasing the sum, therefore `g` is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm computes exactly the greedy numbers `g₁ … g_k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFor a fixed `i` (0‑based) the algorithm sets bit `b` in `cur` iff `cnt[b] > i`,\ni.e. there are still at least `i+1` copies of that bit.\nConsequently `cur` equals the number that receives all bits whose copy count is\n≥ `i+1`, which is precisely the definition of `g_{i+1}`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`maxSum(nums, k)` returned by the algorithm equals the maximum possible sum of\nsquares of any `k` elements obtainable by any sequence of allowed operations.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n1. By Lemma&nbsp;1 and Lemma&nbsp;2 any reachable final array corresponds to a\n   feasible assignment of the bit copies.\n2. By Lemma&nbsp;3 the optimal assignment for the purpose of maximizing the sum\n   of squares of the chosen `k` elements is the greedy one.\n3. Lemma&nbsp;4 shows that the algorithm constructs exactly this greedy\n   assignment and adds the squares of its `k` numbers (modulo `MOD`).\n\nHence the algorithm’s result is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.   Complexity Analysis  \n\n*Counting bits* – `O(n·B)` where `B = 31` (constant).  \n*Building the `k` numbers* – `O(k·B)`.  \n\nOverall  \n\n```\nTime   : O( (n + k) · 31 ) ≤ 3·10⁶ operations\nMemory : O(B) = O(1)   (the 31 counters)\n```\n\nBoth satisfy the limits (`n, k ≤ 10⁵`).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

This element exists exactly\nwhen `k` does not exceed the number of visited integers `|nums|`. ∎\n\n\n\n*Theorem*  \nFor each `\"prev\"` token the algorithm appends to `ans` the correct last‑visited\ninteger as defined in the problem statement.\n\n*Proof.*  \nConsider a `\"prev\"` token at index `i`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the algorithm sets `k = consec`, which is the required number of\nconsecutive `\"prev\"` strings.  \nIf `k ≤ |nums|`, Lemma&nbsp;3 shows that `nums[-k]` is precisely the integer that\nshould be returned, and the algorithm appends it.  \nIf `k > |nums|`, no such integer exists; the specification demands `-1`,\nwhich the algorithm appends.  \nThus the produced value matches the definition for every `\"prev\"` token. ∎\n\n\n\nSince the algorithm processes all tokens, the returned list `ans` is exactly the\nrequired output.\n\n---\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\n*Time*: each word is examined once → **O(n)**.  \n*Space*: we store the visited integers (`nums`) and the answer list (`ans`),\nboth at most length `n` → **O(n)** auxiliary space.\n\n---\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lastVisitedIntegers(self, words: List[str]) -> List[int]:\n        nums: List[int] = []          # visited integers so far\n        ans: List[int] = []           # results for each \"prev\"\n        consec = 0                    # length of current consecutive \"prev\" block\n\n        for w in words:\n            if w == \"prev\":\n                consec += 1\n                k = consec\n                if k <= len(nums):\n                    ans.append(nums[-k])   # k‑th most recent integer\n                else:\n                    ans.append(-1)         # not enough visited integers\n            else:  # an integer string\n                nums.append(int(w))\n                consec = 0                  # streak of \"prev\" ends\n\n        return ans\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms to the\nrequired function signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 100.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 1.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"execution time\": 4.076957702636719e-05}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 117, "group_id": 117, "sample_metadata": null}}

Searching the minimum `k`\n\nIf a certain `k` works, any larger `k` also works:\n\n* larger `k` → smaller `s`\n* the intervals `[low_i , high_i]` become **wider** (both ends move outwards)\n* `Σ low_i` can only increase by at most `1` per step, while `k` itself\n  also increases by `1`.\n\nThus feasibility is monotone, we can binary‑search the answer in the\nrange `[1 , n]`.\n\nComplexities  \n\n* building the frequency map – `O(n)`\n* one feasibility test – `O(m)` where `m` = number of distinct values,\n  `m ≤ n`\n* binary search – `O(log n)` tests  \n\nOverall `O(n log n)` time, `O(m)` extra memory.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible number of groups.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed `k` (hence fixed `s`) a value with frequency `f` can be placed\ninto groups of sizes `s` and `s+1` **iff** `low = ceil(f/(s+1)) ≤ high = floor(f/s)`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf a placement exists, let `g` be the number of groups used.\nFrom the discussion in section&nbsp;1 we have `g·s ≤ f ≤ g·(s+1)`,\nhence `g ≥ f/(s+1)` and `g ≤ f/s`. Because `g` is integer,\n`g ≥ ceil(f/(s+1)) = low` and `g ≤ floor(f/s) = high`.  \nConversely, if `low ≤ high` pick any integer `g` in that interval.\nDefine `y = f - g·s`. Because `g·s ≤ f ≤ g·(s+1)`,\n`0 ≤ y ≤ g`. Use `y` groups of size `s+1` and `g‑y` groups of size `s`;\nthey contain exactly `f` elements. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed `k` a valid global assignment exists **iff**\n`Σ low_i ≤ k ≤ Σ high_i`, where `low_i , high_i` are the bounds of Lemma&nbsp;1\nfor each distinct value.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*If* part: start with `g_i = low_i` for every value.\nTotal groups used = `Σ low_i`. We still need `k - Σ low_i` more groups.\nBecause `k ≤ Σ high_i`, the remaining “capacity”\n`Σ (high_i - low_i)` is at least that number.\nIncrease some `g_i` one by one (still ≤ `high_i`) until the total becomes\nexactly `k`. The construction respects Lemma&nbsp;1, therefore yields a\nvalid assignment.\n\n*Only‑if* part: any valid assignment uses some `g_i` for each value.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 each `g_i` lies inside its interval, thus\n`Σ low_i ≤ Σ g_i = k ≤ Σ high_i`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf a certain `k` is feasible, then every `k' > k` ( `k' ≤ n` ) is also feasible.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIncreasing `k` to `k'` reduces `s = n // k` to `s' = n // k'` (or keeps it\nthe same). Consequently `s' ≤ s` and `s'+1 ≤ s+1`.  \nFor each frequency `f` the new interval becomes\n\n```\nlow'  = ceil( f / (s'+1) )  ≥  ceil( f / (s+1) ) = low\nhigh' = floor( f / s' )     ≥  floor( f / s )   = high\n```\n\nThus every old interval is contained in the new one, so\n`Σ low_i` can increase by at most the increase of `k` itself.\nBecause `k` satisfied `Σ low_i ≤ k ≤ Σ high_i`,\nthe same inequality holds for `k'`. By Lemma&nbsp;2 `k'` is feasible. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe binary‑search procedure returns the smallest feasible `k`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBinary search maintains the invariant  \n`[L , R]` contains all feasible `k` and no infeasible `k` left of `L`.  \nInitially `L = 1` (infeasible in general) and `R = n` (always feasible).\nAt each step we test `mid`.  \n* If `mid` is feasible, by Lemma&nbsp;3 every larger `k` is feasible,\n  so we set `R = mid` (the answer lies in `[L , mid]`).\n* If `mid` is infeasible, all `k ≤ mid` are infeasible, we set `L = mid+1`.\n\nThe loop ends when `L == R`; this value is feasible (otherwise the\ninvariant would be violated) and all smaller numbers are infeasible,\nhence it is the minimum feasible `k`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minGroupsForValidAssignment` returns the minimum possible number of\ngroups satisfying the two conditions of the problem.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm:\n\n1. builds the frequency map – correct by definition.\n2. binary‑searches the smallest `k` that passes the feasibility test.\n   By Lemma&nbsp;4 this `k` is the smallest feasible number of groups.\n3. By Lemma&nbsp;2 feasibility of `k` is equivalent to the existence of a\n   valid assignment with exactly `k` groups.\n\nTherefore the returned `k` is achievable and no smaller `k` is\nachievable, i.e. it is the required minimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Reformulating the condition\n\nFrom (1)\n\n```\nx2 - x1 = diff          where diff = sum1 - sum2                (2)\n```\n\nSo we only have to choose a feasible `x1` (the other value follows from (2)).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.  Different situations\n\n| Situation | Feasibility condition | Minimal final sum `S` |\n|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| **both arrays have zeros** (`z1>0 , z2>0`) | `x1 ≥ z1` and `x1 + diff ≥ z2` | `x1 = max(z1 , z2 - diff)`  <br> `S = sum1 + x1` |\n| **only `nums1` has zeros** (`z1>0 , z2=0`) | `x2 = 0` → from (2) `x1 = -diff` <br> need `x1 ≥ z1` | `S = sum2` (because `x2 = 0`) |\n| **only `nums2` has zeros** (`z1=0 , z2>0`) | `x1 = 0` → from (2) `x2 = diff` <br> need `x2 ≥ z2` | `S = sum1` |\n| **no zeros at all** (`z1=0 , z2=0`) | possible only if `sum1 = sum2` | `S = sum1` (or `sum2`) |\n\nIf the required inequality is not satisfied the task is impossible → return `-1`.\n\nWhy does the minimal `x1` give the minimal final sum?  \n`S = sum1 + x1` (or `sum2 + x2`). `sum1` is fixed, therefore the smaller `x1` (or `x2`) the smaller `S`. The lower bounds above are the smallest values that respect all constraints, hence they yield the minimal possible equal sum.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.

Handle the four cases described above\n       – if a condition fails → return -1\n       – otherwise compute the minimal sum S\n4. Return S\n```\nThe scan is `O(n)` (`n = len(nums1)+len(nums2)`) and uses `O(1)` extra memory.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.  Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible equal sum\nor `-1` when it is impossible.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nIf an array contains `z` zeros, the set of achievable total added values\nis exactly `{ t ∈ ℕ | t ≥ z }`.  \n*Proof.*  \nGive `1` to each zero (total `z`). The remaining `t‑z` can be added to any\nzero, producing any integer `t ≥ z`. No value `< z` is possible because each\nzero contributes at least `1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor the case `z1>0 , z2>0` the algorithm chooses the smallest feasible\n`x1`.\n\n*Proof.*  \nFeasibility requires (by Lemma&nbsp;1) `x1 ≥ z1` and `x2 = x1+diff ≥ z2`,\ni.e. `x1 ≥ z2 - diff`.  \nTherefore any feasible `x1` must satisfy  \n\n```\nx1 ≥ max(z1 , z2 - diff) .\n```\n\nThe algorithm sets `x1` exactly to this maximum, which is the smallest\ninteger fulfilling both inequalities. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor the case `z1>0 , z2=0` the algorithm returns a feasible solution\niff one exists, and the returned sum equals the only possible equal sum.\n\n*Proof.*  \n`z2=0` forces `x2 = 0`. Equation (2) gives `x1 = -diff`.  \nA solution exists ⇔ `x1` is a reachable total for the zeros of `nums1`,\ni.e. `x1 ≥ z1` (Lemma&nbsp;1). The algorithm checks exactly this condition.\nIf it holds, the final sum is `sum2 + x2 = sum2`, which is forced because\n`x2 = 0`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nAnalogous to Lemma&nbsp;3, the algorithm is correct for the case\n`z1=0 , z2>0`.\n\n*Proof.* Identical reasoning with roles exchanged. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nIf `z1 = z2 = 0` the algorithm returns a feasible sum iff the two\noriginal sums are already equal.\n\n*Proof.* No numbers can be changed, so equality is possible only when\n`sum1 = sum2`. The algorithm checks this and returns that sum, otherwise `-1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minSum` returns  \n\n* the minimum possible equal sum of the two arrays after replacing all\n  zeros with positive integers, or  \n* `-1` if no such replacement exists.\n\n*Proof.*  \nAll possible inputs fall into one of the four exhaustive cases handled\nby the algorithm.\n\n*Case 1 (`z1>0 , z2>0`):*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the algorithm picks the smallest feasible `x1`.  \nAny other feasible solution uses `x1' ≥ x1`, giving final sum\n`sum1 + x1' ≥ sum1 + x1`. Hence the algorithm’s sum is minimal.\n\n*Case 2 (`z1>0 , z2=0`):*  \nLemma&nbsp;3 shows the algorithm finds a solution exactly when one exists,\nand the resulting sum is forced (no freedom), thus minimal.\n\n*Case 3 (`z1=0 , z2>0`):*  \nLemma&nbsp;4 gives the same conclusion.\n\n*Case 4 (`z1=0 , z2=0`):*  \nLemma&nbsp;5 proves correctness.\n\nIf the algorithm returns `-1`, in each case we have shown that the\nnecessary feasibility condition fails, therefore no replacement can make\nthe sums equal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

The border position is the *first* character of the second\nblock, and the *second* character of the pair is the *second* character of that same block,\nhence they are equal as well. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed pair `(s[2i], s[2i+1])` the minimum number of flips needed to make the pair\nequal is `0` if the characters are already equal, otherwise `1`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf they are equal, no change is required.  \nIf they differ, turning one of them into the other yields a uniform pair and uses exactly\none flip; any solution must change at least one character, so `1` is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nChanging characters in different pairs never interferes with each other.\n\n**Proof.**  \nPairs are disjoint (they use distinct indices). A flip performed on a position belongs to\nexactly one pair, therefore it cannot affect the equality condition of any other pair. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm `answer = number of mismatching pairs` returns the minimum possible number\nof character changes to make `s` beautiful.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*Upper bound.*  \nFor every mismatching pair the algorithm flips exactly one of its two characters,\nas described in Lemma&nbsp;2. After performing these flips all pairs become equal,\nhence by Lemma&nbsp;1 the whole string is beautiful. The number of performed flips equals\nthe algorithm’s output, so a solution with that many changes exists.\n\n*Lower bound.*  \nConsider any feasible solution that makes the string beautiful.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 every pair must be uniform in the final string.\nFor each pair that was originally mismatching, at least one character must be flipped,\notherwise the pair would stay non‑uniform, contradicting beauty.\nThus any solution needs **at least** one flip per originally mismatching pair,\ni.e. at least the algorithm’s count.\n\nSince the algorithm achieves this lower bound, it is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Any concrete left index `i` of a mountain\nmust satisfy the same conditions, therefore `nums[i] ≥ min_left(j)`.  \nThe same argument holds for the right side. Adding the three terms gives the\ninequality. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 2**  \nIf `min_left(j)` and `min_right(j)` both exist, the triplet consisting of\ntheir indices together with `j` is a valid mountain.\n\n*Proof.*  \n`min_left(j)` was obtained from some index `i < j` with `nums[i] < nums[j]`.  \n`min_right(j)` was obtained from some index `k > j` with `nums[k] < nums[j]`.  \nThus `i < j < k` and the two strict inequalities required for a mountain hold,\nso `(i, j, k)` is a mountain. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 3**  \nFor each `j` the algorithm computes exactly the value\n`min_left(j) + nums[j] + min_right(j)` when both minima exist.\n\n*Proof.*  \nThe two inner loops enumerate all indices left of `j` (resp. right of `j`) and\nkeep the smallest value that satisfies the `< nums[j]` condition.\nConsequently after the loops finish, `min_left` equals `min_left(j)` and\n`min_right` equals `min_right(j)`. The algorithm then adds them to `nums[j]`. ∎\n\n\n\n**Theorem**  \nThe algorithm returns the minimum possible sum of any mountain triplet,\nor `-1` if none exists.\n\n*Proof.*  \n\n*Existence case.*  \nAssume at least one mountain exists. Let `(i\\*, j\\*, k\\*)` be a mountain with the\nminimum possible sum `S\\*`.  \nFor its middle index `j\\*`, by Lemma&nbsp;1 any mountain using `j\\*` has sum at\nleast `min_left(j\\*) + nums[j\\*] + min_right(j\\*)`.  \nBecause `(i\\*, j\\*, k\\*)` itself is a mountain, Lemma&nbsp;2 shows that the\ntriplet built from the minima is also a mountain, therefore its sum is **exactly**\n`min_left(j\\*) + nums[j\\*] + min_right(j\\*)`.  \nConsequently `S\\* = min_left(j\\*) + nums[j\\*] + min_right(j\\*)`.  \nThe algorithm evaluates this expression for every `j`, in particular for `j\\*`,\nand keeps the smallest value in `ans`. Hence `ans ≤ S\\*`.  \nOn the other hand, any value stored in `ans` corresponds to a concrete mountain\n(Lemma&nbsp;2), so it cannot be smaller than the optimal sum `S\\*`. Thus `ans = S\\*`,\nwhich the algorithm returns.\n\n*Non‑existence case.*  \nIf no mountain exists, then for every `j` at least one of the minima is missing,\nso the algorithm never updates `ans`. It stays at `+∞` and the final return\nvalue is `-1`. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\n`n ≤ 50`.\n\n* Outer loop over `j` : `O(n)`\n* Two inner linear scans for each `j` : `O(n)`\n\nTotal time `O(n²)` ≤ `2500` operations – trivial for the limits.  \nExtra space used is `O(1)`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        INF = float('inf')\n        n = len(nums)\n        answer = INF\n\n        for j in range(1, n - 1):\n            # best left element smaller than nums[j]\n            min_left = INF\n            for i in range(j):\n                if nums[i] < nums[j] and nums[i] < min_left:\n                    min_left = nums[i]\n\n            # best right element smaller than nums[j]\n            min_right = INF\n            for k in range(j + 1, n):\n                if nums[k] < nums[j] and nums[k] < min_right:\n                    min_right = nums[k]\n\n            # if both sides exist, update answer\n            if min_left < INF and min_right < INF:\n                candidate = min_left + nums[j] + min_right\n                if candidate < answer:\n                    answer = candidate\n\n        return -1 if answer == INF else answer\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms to\nthe required function signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: name 'min_left' is not defined\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 122, "group_id": 122, "sample_metadata": null}}

Any solution that swaps this index would have a larger cost,\n  therefore the optimal choice is to keep.\n\n* If keep fails but swap succeeds, any feasible solution must swap this\n  index (otherwise (3)–(4) are violated). The algorithm adds exactly the\n  unavoidable cost `1`.\n\n* If both orientations fail, no feasible solution exists for this\n  candidate pair, because the inequalities cannot be satisfied at this\n  index regardless of the decision. The algorithm marks the candidate as\n  impossible.\n\nSince the decision for each index is forced (or uniquely optimal) and\nindependent of the decisions on other indices, summing the forced costs\nyields the global minimum for the candidate pair. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf a solution exists for the original problem, then its final last\npair is either `(a , b)` (no swap on the last index) or `(b , a)` (swap\non the last index).\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe only operation that can change the value at position `n‑1` is a swap\non that very index, because swaps are only allowed between the two arrays\nat the *same* index. Hence after all operations the pair at the last\nposition is either the original pair `(a , b)` or the swapped pair\n`(b , a)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf a feasible solution exists, the algorithm will consider a candidate\npair that matches the solution’s final last values and will compute a\ncost not larger than the solution’s number of swaps.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the solution’s final last pair is one of the two candidates\nenumerated by the algorithm.  \nFor that candidate, Lemma&nbsp;1 tells us that the algorithm finds the\nminimum possible number of swaps on the remaining indices. The solution\nuses some concrete set of swaps, therefore its number of swaps on those\nindices is at least the minimum computed by the algorithm. Adding the\n(last‑index) cost (0 or 1) gives a total not larger than the solution’s\ntotal number of operations. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor each candidate pair, any feasible solution must use at least the\nnumber of swaps counted by the algorithm for that candidate.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider a feasible solution that ends with the candidate pair `(t1 , t2)`.\nFor each index `i < n‑1` the solution’s orientation must satisfy (3)–(4).\nIf the keep orientation already satisfies them, the solution may keep\n(i.e. cost `0`). If it does not, the only way to satisfy the inequalities\nis to swap, incurring cost `1`. This is exactly the rule used by the\nalgorithm, therefore the solution’s cost on each index is **≥** the\nalgorithm’s cost for that index, and summing over all indices yields the\ndesired inequality. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns  \n\n* the minimum possible number of operations that make both conditions\n  true, or  \n\n* `-1` if no sequence of operations can achieve the conditions.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If the algorithm returns a finite number `C`.*  \n`C` is the minimum over the two candidates of the value computed by the\nalgorithm. For the candidate that attains `C`, Lemma&nbsp;1 guarantees a\nconcrete sequence of swaps with exactly `C` operations, therefore a\nsolution with `C` operations exists.\n\n*Optimality.*  \nAssume there exists any feasible solution with `S` operations.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 its final last pair is one of the two candidates.\nFor that candidate Lemma&nbsp;4 shows that any feasible solution needs at\nleast the number of swaps counted by the algorithm, i.e. `C ≤ S`.  \nThus no solution can use fewer than `C` operations, and `C` is optimal.\n\n*If the algorithm returns `-1`.*  \nBoth candidates were marked impossible, meaning for each candidate there\nexists an index where neither orientation satisfies the required\ninequalities. By Lemma&nbsp;2 any feasible solution must end with one of\nthose two candidates, but for each candidate at least one index cannot\nbe made valid, contradicting feasibility. Hence no solution exists. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

How to distribute the remaining weights ?\n\nAll remaining weights are distinct powers of two, i.e. each weight is\nstrictly larger than the sum of all smaller weights.\nFor such a set the following greedy rule is optimal:\n\n```\nprocess the weights from the largest to the smallest\nadd the current weight to the currently smaller number\n```\n\n*Why is it optimal?*  \nWhen we look at a weight `w`, all later (smaller) weights together sum to\nless than `w`.  \nIf we ever gave `w` to the larger number, the final difference between the\ntwo numbers could never be reduced enough by the remaining smaller\nweights.  \nTherefore the only chance to obtain the smallest possible final\ndifference – and consequently the largest product (product of two\npositive numbers with fixed sum is maximal when they are as equal as\npossible) – is to give `w` to the smaller side at that moment.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible value of  \n`(a xor x) * (b xor x)`.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor every bit `i` with `C_i = 0` (i.e. `aLow_i = bLow_i`) the optimal\nsolution sets that bit to `1` in both final numbers.\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf the bit is `0` in both numbers, changing it to `1` adds `2ⁱ` to each\nfactor, increasing the product by  \n\n```\n( (A+2ⁱ)(B+2ⁱ) ) – (A·B) = 2ⁱ·(A+B) + (2ⁱ)²  > 0 .\n```\n\nThus any optimal solution must set it to `1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nLet `W = { w₁ > w₂ > … > w_k }` be the set of weights `2ⁱ` for which\n`C_i = 1`.  \nAmong all assignments of each `w_j` to either `A` or `B`,\nthe greedy rule “give `w_j` to the currently smaller number” yields the\nminimum possible final absolute difference `|A – B|`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nInduction over the processed weights.\n\n*Base.* Before any weight is processed the claim is trivially true.\n\n*Induction step.* Assume after handling `w₁ … w_{j-1}` the greedy\nconstruction has the smallest possible difference among all assignments\nof those `j‑1` weights.\nConsider weight `w_j`.  \nAll later weights sum to less than `w_j`.  \nIf we assign `w_j` to the larger side, the difference after this step is\nat least `w_j – (sum of later weights) > 0`.  \nNo later choices can make the final difference smaller than the one\nobtained by assigning `w_j` to the smaller side, because they cannot\novercome the excess `w_j`.  \nTherefore any optimal final difference must also assign `w_j` to the\nsmaller side at this moment, which is exactly what the greedy rule does.\nThus after processing `w_j` the greedy construction still has the\nminimum possible difference. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor two non‑negative numbers with a fixed sum, the product is maximised\nwhen their absolute difference is minimal.\n\n**Proof.**  \nLet the numbers be `x` and `y`, `x+y = S`.  \nProduct `P = x·y = x·(S−x) = −x² + S·x`.  \n`P` is a concave quadratic in `x`, attaining its maximum at `x = S/2`,\ni.e. when `x` and `y` are as equal as possible, i.e. when `|x−y|` is\nminimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm produces numbers `A` and `B` that maximise the product\n`(A0 + p)·(B0 + q)` under the constraint `p xor q = C`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the algorithm correctly fixes all bits with `C_i = 0`.  \nThe remaining bits correspond exactly to the weight set `W` of Lemma&nbsp;2.\nThe algorithm distributes `W` using the greedy rule, therefore by\nLemma&nbsp;2 the final absolute difference `|A−B|` is minimal among all\nfeasible assignments.\nThe sum `A + B` is constant (it equals `A0 + B0 + Σ_{C_i=0} 2ⁱ + Σ_{C_i=1} 2ⁱ`),\nso by Lemma&nbsp;3 the product is maximal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nFor any `x` with `0 ≤ x < 2ⁿ` the pair `(a xor x , b xor x)` satisfies the\nconstraint `p xor q = C` and therefore is considered by the algorithm.\n\n**Proof.**  \nDefine `p = aLow xor x`, `q = bLow xor x`.  \nThen `p xor q = (aLow xor x) xor (bLow xor x) = aLow xor bLow = C`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`maximumXorProduct` returns the maximum possible value of  \n`(a xor x) * (b xor x)` for all `0 ≤ x < 2ⁿ`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*Existence.*  \nFor any admissible `x` the corresponding low parts `p,q` satisfy the\nxor‑constraint (Lemma&nbsp;5).  \nThe algorithm enumerates **all** feasible `(p,q)` pairs (by the\nconstruction described in Lemma&nbsp;4) and selects the one with the\nlargest product.\n\n*Optimality.*  \nLemma&nbsp;4 shows that among all feasible pairs the algorithm’s pair\nhas the largest product. Consequently no `x` can yield a larger product.\nThus the returned value is the global maximum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible score.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any set `S` of indices, the minimum total cost to make all\n`nums[i] (i∈S)` equal is obtained by choosing a median of the values\n`{nums[i]}` as the target.\n\n**Proof.**  \nStandard property of absolute deviations: the function  \n`f(t)= Σ |x_i - t|` is convex and its sub‑gradient changes sign at any\nmedian, therefore any median minimises `f`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed size `m`, among all subsets of size `m` the one with the\nminimum possible cost (as defined in Lemma&nbsp;1) is a contiguous block\nin the sorted array.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake any optimal subset `S` of size `m` and sort its values.\nIf the subset is not a contiguous block, there exists an element `x`\noutside the block but between two elements of the block.\nReplacing the farthest element of the block by `x` can only reduce the\nsum of distances to the median (the median does not move past `x`),\ncontradicting optimality. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor a contiguous block `[l … r]` in the sorted array the cost computed\nby the formula in the algorithm equals the minimum cost to make the\nwhole block equal (Lemma&nbsp;1).\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe median of the block is `a[m]`.  \nElements left of `m` must be increased to `a[m]`; each contributes\n`a[m] - a[i]`. Summing them gives `a[m]*(m-l) - Σ a[l … m-1]`.  \nElements right of `m` must be decreased; each contributes\n`a[i] - a[m]`. Summing gives `Σ a[m+1 … r] - a[m]*(r-m)`.  \nAdding both parts yields exactly the formula. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nDuring the execution, after the inner `while` loop finishes,\nthe current window `[l … r]` satisfies `cost ≤ k` and is the *largest*\nwindow ending at `r` that satisfies the constraint.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`r` is fixed. While `cost > k` we increment `l`.  \nIncreasing `l` can only remove elements from the left side, which never\nincreases the cost (the median may move right, possibly decreasing the\ncost further). Therefore the loop stops at the smallest `l` for which\n`cost ≤ k`. Any smaller `l` would have been examined and found too\nexpensive, so the resulting window is the longest feasible one ending\nat `r`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nFor every `r` the algorithm records the maximum feasible window length\namong all windows that end at `r`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the window after the `while` loop is exactly that maximum\nfeasible window. The algorithm updates `ans = max(ans, r-l+1)`, thus\nrecording its length. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 6  \n`ans` at the end of the algorithm equals the size of the largest\nsubset of indices that can be made equal with total cost ≤ k.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider any feasible subset `S`. By Lemma&nbsp;2 we can replace it by a\ncontiguous block `B` of the same size that is also feasible.\nLet `r` be the rightmost index of `B`. When the outer loop reaches this\n`r`, Lemma&nbsp;5 guarantees that the algorithm has examined a window\nof size `|B|` (or larger) that ends at `r` and is feasible, therefore\n`ans ≥ |B| = |S|`.  \nConversely, `ans` is always the size of some feasible window, hence a\nfeasible subset. So `ans` is both an upper and a lower bound on the\noptimal value, i.e. it is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`maxFrequencyScore` returns the maximum possible score after at most\n`k` operations.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm sorts the array, then by Lemmas&nbsp;3–5 correctly\ncomputes for every right endpoint the largest feasible window, and by\nLemma&nbsp;6 the maximum over all right endpoints equals the optimum.\nTherefore the returned value is exactly the required maximum score. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns exactly the number of admissible\ndistributions.\n\n---\n\n#### Lemma 1  \nFor any non‑negative integer `k`, the number of non‑negative integer triples\n`(x, y, z)` with `x + y + z = k` equals `C(k+2, 2)`.\n\n*Proof.* Classic stars‑and‑bars argument. ∎\n\n\n\n#### Lemma 2  \nLet `S_A` be the set of triples where child `A` receives more than `L`\ncandies. Then  \n\n```\n|S_A| = C(n-(L+1)+2, 2)   if n ≥ L+1,\n|S_A| = 0                otherwise.\n```\n\n*Proof.* Replace `a = (L+1) + a'` with `a' ≥ 0`. The remaining sum is\n`n-(L+1)`. By Lemma&nbsp;1 the number of solutions is the claimed binomial\ncoefficient, which is defined as `0` when the sum is negative. ∎\n\n\n\n#### Lemma 3  \nFor any two distinct children `A, B`, the size of the intersection\n`S_A ∩ S_B` equals  \n\n```\nC(n-2·(L+1)+2, 2)   if n ≥ 2·(L+1),\n0                   otherwise.\n```\n\n*Proof.* Remove `L+1` from both `a` and `b`. The remaining sum is\n`n-2·(L+1)`. Apply Lemma&nbsp;1. ∎\n\n\n\n#### Lemma 4  \nThe size of the triple intersection `S_A ∩ S_B ∩ S_C` equals  \n\n```\nC(n-3·(L+1)+2, 2)   if n ≥ 3·(L+1),\n0                   otherwise.\n```\n\n*Proof.* Analogous to Lemma&nbsp;3, removing `L+1` from each variable. ∎\n\n\n\n#### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the number of triples `(a,b,c)` with  \n\n```\na + b + c = n ,   0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ L .\n```\n\n*Proof.*  \nLet `U` be the set of all unrestricted triples (size `total` from Lemma 1).  \nDefine `S_A, S_B, S_C` as in Lemma 2.  \nThe admissible triples are exactly `U \\ (S_A ∪ S_B ∪ S_C)`.  \nBy the Inclusion–Exclusion Principle\n\n```\n|U \\ (S_A ∪ S_B ∪ S_C)|\n = |U|\n   - (|S_A|+|S_B|+|S_C|)\n   + (|S_A∩S_B|+|S_A∩S_C|+|S_B∩S_C|)\n   - |S_A∩S_B∩S_C|\n```\n\nAll three single sets have the same size (`single`), all three pairwise\nintersections have the same size (`double`), and the triple intersection has\nsize `triple`. Substituting the expressions from Lemmas 2‑4 yields exactly the\nformula used by the algorithm. Hence the algorithm counts precisely the\ndesired triples. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n### 4.

While the current length is at least `2` we are\nallowed to delete, and we stop when the length becomes `L`. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 2**  \nIf the three strings become equal after some operations, the final string\nmust be a common prefix of the three original strings.\n\n*Proof.*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 each final string is a prefix of its original.\nSince all three final strings are equal, that string is a prefix of each\noriginal string, i.e. a common prefix. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 3**  \nLet `L` be the length of the longest common prefix of the three strings.\nFor any common prefix of length `k` (with `1 ≤ k ≤ L`) the total number of\noperations needed is  \n`(len(s1)+len(s2)+len(s3) - 3·k)`.  \nThis value is strictly decreasing in `k`.\n\n*Proof.*  \nFrom Lemma&nbsp;1 the number of deletions for a string of length `len(si)`\nto reach length `k` is `len(si) - k`. Summing over the three strings gives the\nformula. Since `k` appears with a negative coefficient, larger `k` yields a\nsmaller sum. ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 4**  \nIf `L = 0` (no common prefix) it is impossible to make the strings equal.\n\n*Proof.*  \nAny equal final string must be a common prefix by Lemma&nbsp;2, but there is\nnone of positive length, contradicting the fact that a string must have\nlength at least 1. ∎\n\n\n\n**Theorem**  \nThe algorithm returns  \n\n* `-1` iff it is impossible to make the three strings equal, and  \n* otherwise the minimum possible number of operations.\n\n*Proof.*  \n\n*Impossible case.*  \nIf the algorithm finds `L = 0` it returns `-1`. By Lemma&nbsp;4 equality is\nindeed impossible. Conversely, if equality is impossible, there is no\ncommon prefix of length ≥ 1, so the longest common prefix length is `0`,\nand the algorithm returns `-1`.\n\n*Possible case.*  \nAssume `L ≥ 1`. The algorithm returns  \n`ops = len(s1)+len(s2)+len(s3) - 3·L`.  \nChoosing the longest common prefix of length `L` is feasible (Lemma 1) and\nneeds exactly `ops` operations. For any other feasible common prefix of\nlength `k` (Lemma 2) we have `k ≤ L`; by Lemma 3 the required operations are\n`len(s1)+len(s2)+len(s3) - 3·k ≥ ops`. Hence no other strategy uses fewer\noperations, and `ops` is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\nThe longest common prefix is found by scanning at most `min(len(s1),len(s2),len(s3)) ≤ 100`\ncharacters.\n\n```\nTime   : O(min length) ≤ O(100)\nMemory : O(1)\n```\n\nBoth are easily within the limits.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def findMinimumOperations(self, s1: str, s2: str, s3: str) -> int:\n        # step 1: compute longest common prefix length\n        min_len = min(len(s1), len(s2), len(s3))\n        lcp_len = 0\n        while lcp_len < min_len:\n            ch = s1[lcp_len]\n            if s2[lcp_len] == ch and s3[lcp_len] == ch:\n                lcp_len += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        # step 2: impossible if no common prefix of length >= 1\n        if lcp_len == 0:\n            return -1\n\n        # step 3: total deletions needed\n        total_ops = (len(s1) - lcp_len) + (len(s2) - lcp_len) + (len(s3) - lcp_len)\n        return total_ops\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: name 's1' is not defined\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 136, "group_id": 136, "sample_metadata": null}}

Reversing the view\n\n`non‑decreasing` from left to right  ⇔  `non‑increasing` from right to left.\n\nIf we scan the original array **from right to left** we already know the\nblocks that lie to the right of the current position – they are already\nfixed.  \nWhile moving left we try to start a *new* block with the current element.\nIf its sum is larger than the block that is immediately on its right,\nthe monotonicity would be broken, therefore the two blocks have to be\nmerged.  \nAfter merging the new (larger) sum may still be larger than the next block\non the right, so we continue merging until the condition is satisfied.\n\nThe procedure is completely greedy:\n\n```\nstack   – sums of the already created blocks, from right to left\n          (top of the stack = the block that touches the current position)\n\nfor i = n‑1 … 0\n        cur = nums[i]                     # start a new block with a single element\n        while stack is not empty and cur > stack[-1]:\n                cur += stack.pop()        # merge with the block on the right\n        stack.append(cur)                 # the (maybe merged) block becomes the new top\nanswer = len(stack)\n```\n\n*Why does it work?*\n\n* **Only necessary merges** – a merge is performed **iff** the new block\n  would be larger than the block on its right, i.e. the monotonicity would be\n  violated. Any valid final partition must also merge those two blocks,\n  otherwise the order of sums would be wrong.  \n  Hence we never merge more than required.\n\n* **Merging order is optimal** – when we merge the current block with the\n  right neighbour we obtain the smallest possible sum that is still\n  `≥` the neighbour (because we only add the neighbour’s whole sum).\n  Any later merge can only increase this sum, never decrease it.\n  Therefore the number of blocks that stay to the left of the current\n  position is maximal.\n\n* **Amortised linear time** – each original element is pushed onto the\n  stack once and can be popped at most once, so the total number of stack\n  operations is `O(n)`.\n\nConsequently the algorithm yields the maximum possible number of blocks,\ni.e. the maximum length of a non‑decreasing array after the allowed\noperations.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the length of the longest possible\nnon‑decreasing array.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nDuring the right‑to‑left scan the stack always contains block sums that are\nstrictly decreasing from bottom to top (i.e. from rightmost block to the\ncurrent leftmost block).\n\n**Proof.**  \nInitially the stack is empty – the property holds.\nAssume it holds before processing position `i`.\n\n*We create `cur = nums[i]`.*  \nIf the `while` loop is never entered, `cur ≤ stack[-1]` (or the stack is\nempty), therefore after `stack.append(cur)` the decreasing order is kept.\n\nIf the loop is entered, we repeatedly pop the top element while\n`cur > stack[-1]`. After the loop finishes we have either an empty stack\nor `cur ≤ stack[-1]`. Appending `cur` again yields a decreasing order.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nWhen the algorithm finishes processing index `i`, the blocks represented\nby the stack can be extended to a **valid** partition of the suffix\n`nums[i … n‑1]` (i.e. their sums are non‑decreasing from left to right).\n\n**Proof.**  \nInduction on `i` from `n‑1` down to `0`.\n\n*Base (`i = n‑1`).*  \nThe stack contains a single element `nums[n‑1]`. Trivially a valid\npartition of the suffix consisting of one element.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement true after processing `i+1`.  \nNow we handle `nums[i]`.\n\n*If the while‑loop is not executed* we start a new block with sum `cur`\nthat satisfies `cur ≤ stack[-1]` (or the stack is empty).  \nAppending it to the left of the already valid partition keeps the\nnon‑decreasing order, therefore the new stack corresponds to a valid\npartition of `nums[i … n‑1]`.\n\n*If the while‑loop merges some right blocks*, we replace the rightmost\n`k` blocks by a single block whose sum is `cur` (the accumulated value).\nAll those `k` blocks together formed a suffix whose total sum is exactly\n`cur`. Replacing them by their total does not change the overall sum of\nthe suffix, and because `cur ≤` the next block on the right (the loop\nstops only then), the monotonicity with the remaining blocks is preserved.\nThus the new stack again represents a valid partition of the suffix.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every index `i` the algorithm creates **the maximum possible number**\nof blocks inside the suffix `nums[i … n‑1]`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider the moment just after processing `i`.  \nIf the algorithm did **not** merge `cur` with the block on its right,\nthen `cur ≤` that block, so a partition with `cur` as a separate block is\nfeasible. Keeping it separate yields more blocks than merging, therefore\nany optimal solution must also keep it separate.\n\nIf the algorithm **did** merge because `cur >` the right block, any\npartition that keeps `cur` separate would violate the required\nnon‑decreasing order (its sum would be larger than the following block).\nHence every feasible partition must merge `cur` with at least that right\nblock. The algorithm merges exactly those blocks and no others, so it\nuses the smallest possible number of merges and consequently the largest\npossible number of blocks.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nWhen the whole array has been processed, `len(stack)` equals the maximum\npossible length of a non‑decreasing array obtainable by the allowed\noperations.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 the stack after the last iteration (i = 0) corresponds to a\nvalid partition of the whole array, therefore `len(stack)` is *achievable*.\n\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the algorithm never uses more merges than any other\nfeasible partition, i.e. it never creates fewer blocks than the optimum.\nThus no partition can contain more than `len(stack)` blocks.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`findMaximumLength` returns the maximum length of a non‑decreasing array\nthat can be obtained by repeatedly replacing sub‑arrays with their sums.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe method implements exactly the algorithm proved correct in Lemma&nbsp;4.\nTherefore its returned value is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Complexity Analysis  \n\n*Time* – each element is pushed onto the stack once and can be popped at\nmost once. All other operations are `O(1)`.  \n`T(n) = O(n)`.\n\n*Memory* – the stack holds at most `n` sums.  \n`M(n) = O(n)` (worst case when the original array is already non‑decreasing).\n\nBoth limits satisfy the constraints (`n ≤ 10^5`).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the number of good partitions.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nAn index `i` is a legal cut (a sub‑array may end at `i`) **iff**\n`i` equals the maximum last‑occurrence of any value appearing in the prefix\n`nums[0 … i]`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If* `i` equals that maximum, every value seen so far finishes no later than\n`i`; therefore no value appears after `i`, so a cut after `i` does not split a\nvalue between two parts – the cut is legal.\n\n*Only‑if*: suppose a cut after `i` is legal. Then for every value `v` that\nappears in the prefix, all its occurrences are inside the prefix, i.e. its\nlast occurrence index `last[v] ≤ i`. Consequently the maximum of those\n`last[v]` is ≤ `i`. Because `i` itself belongs to the prefix, the maximum cannot\nbe smaller than `i`. Hence it equals `i`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nDuring the scan, just before processing index `i`,\n`cum` equals  \n\n```\nΣ dp[j]   over all legal cut positions j < i   +   dp[-1] .\n```\n\n**Proof.** By induction over `i`.\n\n*Base (`i = 0`)*: before any index we have `cum = 1 = dp[-1]`. No legal cut\nexists with `j < 0`. Property holds.\n\n*Induction step*: assume the property holds before index `i`.  \nIf `i` is **not** a legal cut, `cum` is unchanged, and the set of legal cuts\n`j < i+1` is the same as for `j < i`; the invariant stays true.\n\nIf `i` **is** a legal cut, we compute `dp_i = cum` and then set  \n\n```\ncum ← cum + dp_i .\n```\n\nNow `cum` equals the previous sum plus `dp_i`, i.e. the sum over all legal\ncuts `j ≤ i` plus `dp[-1]`. This is exactly the required sum for the next\niteration (`i+1`). ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nWhen index `i` is a legal cut, the algorithm sets `dp_i` to the number of good\npartitions of the prefix `0 … i`.\n\n**Proof.** By Lemma&nbsp;2, just before processing `i` we have  \n\n```\ncum = Σ dp[j] (legal j < i) + dp[-1] .\n```\n\nEvery good partition of the prefix ending at `i` consists of a good partition\nof some earlier prefix ending at a legal cut `j` (or the empty prefix) followed\nby the last sub‑array `j+1 … i`. The number of possibilities for the earlier\npart is exactly `dp[j]`. Summing over all admissible `j` gives the total\ncount, which is precisely `cum`. The algorithm stores `dp_i = cum`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \n`dp_{n-1}` computed by the algorithm equals the total number of good\npartitions of the whole array.\n\n**Proof.** By Lemma&nbsp;1, index `n‑1` is always a legal cut, so the algorithm\ncomputes `dp_{n-1}`. By Lemma&nbsp;3 this value counts all good partitions of the\nprefix `0 … n‑1`, i.e. of the entire array. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`numberOfGoodPartitions` returns the number of good partitions of `nums`\nmodulo `10^9+7`.\n\n**Proof.** The algorithm:\n\n1. Builds `last` correctly (single pass, last occurrence of each value).\n2. Scans the array, identifies exactly the legal cut positions\n   (Lemma&nbsp;1).\n3.

Returns `dp_{n-1}` which equals the total number of good partitions\n   (Lemma&nbsp;4).\n\nAll arithmetic is performed modulo `M = 10^9+7`, therefore the returned value\nis the required answer. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Create list P = [(value, index) for each position] and sort it by value.\n2. Scan P, building components:\n        start a new component when current.value - previous.value > limit.\n   For each component store\n        - the list of its indices   (unsorted)\n        - the list of its values    (already sorted because of step 1)\n3. For every component:\n        sort its indices increasingly\n        assign the sorted values to those indices in that order\n4. Return the resulting array.\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the lexicographically smallest array\nobtainable by the allowed swaps.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nTwo array elements belong to the same connected component of the\nvalue‑difference graph **iff** they are in the same group produced in step 2\n(their sorted values are linked by a chain of differences ≤ `limit`).\n\n**Proof.**  \n*If*: In the sorted order every consecutive pair inside a group differs\nby ≤ `limit`; therefore there is an edge between them.\nBy transitivity of connectivity the whole group is a single component.\n\n*Only‑if*: Suppose two values are in the same graph component.\nThere exists a path `v₁, v₂, …, v_k` with each consecutive difference ≤ `limit`.\nWhen the whole array is sorted, the values appear in non‑decreasing order,\nso the path’s vertices appear as a subsequence of the sorted list where\neach consecutive pair still differs by ≤ `limit`. Hence they lie inside the\nsame group created by the scanning rule. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nDuring any sequence of allowed swaps, the set of indices that contain\nvalues of a particular component never changes.\n\n**Proof.**  \nA swap exchanges two values whose difference ≤ `limit`. By Lemma 1 those\ntwo values belong to the same component, because otherwise their\ndifference would be larger than `limit`. Hence a swap never moves a value\noutside its component, and consequently the indices occupied by a\ncomponent stay invariant. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nInside a component we can realize **any** permutation of its values\namong its indices using allowed swaps.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe component’s values form a connected graph (Lemma 1).  \nFor any edge `(a,b)` we can directly swap the two values (difference ≤\n`limit`). The set of transpositions corresponding to the edges of a\nconnected graph generates the full symmetric group on its vertices\n(classical result: adjacent transpositions along a spanning tree are enough).\nTherefore any permutation can be built as a product of allowed swaps. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor a fixed component, assigning its sorted values to its sorted indices\nproduces the lexicographically smallest possible sub‑array on those\nindices.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider the smallest index `i` of the component.\nAll values that can appear at `i` are exactly the component’s values\n(Lemma 2). The smallest among them yields the smallest possible entry at\nposition `i`. After fixing that value, the same argument applies to the\nsecond smallest index, etc. Hence the described assignment is optimal\nfor the component. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nThe array produced by the algorithm is lexicographically minimal among\nall arrays reachable by the allowed swaps.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake the first position `p` where the algorithm’s result `A` differs from\nany other reachable array `B`.  \n`p` belongs to some component `C`.  \nBoth `A[p]` and `B[p]` are values of `C` (Lemma 2).  \nBy Lemma 4, `A[p]` is the smallest value that any reachable array can place\nat `p`. Therefore `A[p] ≤ B[p]`.  \nIf `A[p] < B[p]` then `A` is lexicographically smaller.\nIf `A[p] = B[p]` then `p` would not be the first differing position – a\ncontradiction. Hence `A` is lexicographically minimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm returns the lexicographically smallest array that can be\nobtained by any sequence of allowed swaps.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma 3 the algorithm’s construction (permuting values arbitrarily inside\neach component) is feasible.  \nBy Lemma 5 no other feasible array is lexicographically smaller.\nThus the returned array is exactly the desired optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\n*Sorting* `n` pairs: `O(n log n)` time, `O(n)` extra space.  \n*Scanning* and building components: `O(n)` time.  \n*Sorting indices* inside each component: the total size of all index\nlists is `n`, so overall `O(n log n)` in the worst case (when a single\ncomponent contains all indices).  \nOverall time complexity: **`O(n log n)`**.  \nAdditional memory: the sorted list and the result array – **`O(n)`**.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Reference Implementation  (Python 3)\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lexicographicallySmallestArray(self, nums: List[int], limit: int) -> List[int]:\n        n = len(nums)\n        # pair each value with its original index\n        pairs = [(val, idx) for idx, val in enumerate(nums)]\n        # sort by value\n        pairs.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n        # result array to fill\n        res = [0] * n\n\n        # temporary containers for the current component\n        comp_vals = []   # values (already sorted)\n        comp_idx = []    # original indices (unsorted)\n\n        prev_val = None\n\n        for val, idx in pairs:\n            if prev_val is not None and val - prev_val > limit:\n                # finish current component\n                comp_idx.sort()\n                # assign sorted values to sorted indices\n                for i, pos in enumerate(comp_idx):\n                    res[pos] = comp_vals[i]\n                # start new component\n                comp_vals = []\n                comp_idx = []\n            # add current element to the component\n            comp_vals.append(val)\n            comp_idx.append(idx)\n            prev_val = val\n\n        # handle the last component\n        if comp_vals:\n            comp_idx.sort()\n            for i, pos in enumerate(comp_idx):\n                res[pos] = comp_vals[i]\n\n        return res\n```\n\nThe code follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms\nto the required function signature.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: invalid character '\\u2013' (U+2013) (<string>, line 38)\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 142, "group_id": 142, "sample_metadata": null}}

Counting substrings inside one block  \n\nInside a block we only have to care about the *frequency* condition.\n\n*Let `freq[c]` be the current number of character `c` in the sliding\nwindow `[L … R]` (both inclusive).*\n\nThe window is always kept **valid with respect to the upper bound**\n`freq[c] ≤ k`.  \nIf a character would become `k+1` we move the left border `L` to the\nright until the offending character is back to `k`.\n\nAdditional data we maintain\n\n* `distinct` – number of characters with `freq > 0`\n* `good`      – number of characters with `freq == k`\n\nFor the current window\n\n```\nwindow is a complete substring  ⇔  good == distinct\n```\n\nbecause then every character that occurs does it exactly `k` times.\n\nThe algorithm is a classic two‑pointer (sliding window) scan:\n\n```\nL = 0\nfor R = 0 … len(block)-1\n        add block[R] to the window\n        while some character count > k\n                remove block[L] from the window, L += 1\n        if good == distinct\n                answer += 1          # the window [L … R] itself is complete\n```\n\nWhy does this count **all** complete substrings?\n\n* The right border `R` visits every possible end position once.\n* For a fixed `R` the left border `L` is the **smallest** index such that\n  the window `[L … R]` respects `freq ≤ k`.  \n  If `[L … R]` is complete, any longer window ending at `R`\n  would contain a character with count `< k` (the newly added character)\n  and therefore cannot be complete.\n* Consequently each complete substring appears exactly once –\n  when its right end is processed and its left end equals the current `L`.\n\nThe whole scan is linear: each character is added once and removed once,\nso `O(length_of_block)` time and `O(1)` extra memory (26 counters).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the number of complete substrings.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nInside a block, a substring satisfies the “adjacent difference ≤ 2”\ncondition **iff** it is completely contained in the block.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy construction of a block every pair of neighbours inside the block\nhas difference ≤ 2, and at each block border there is a neighbour pair\nwith difference > 2.  \nTherefore a substring that stays inside the block never sees a violating\npair, while any substring crossing a border necessarily contains that\npair and violates the condition. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nDuring the scan of a block the invariant  \n\n```\n∀c : freq[c] ≤ k\n```\n\nholds.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWhen a new character `x` is added, `freq[x]` may become `k+1`.  \nThe `while` loop then repeatedly removes the leftmost character until\n`freq[x] ≤ k`.  \nAll other characters are only decreased while removing, never increased,\nhence they stay ≤ k as well. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nAt any moment of the scan  \n\n```\ngood == distinct   ⇔   the current window [L … R] is a complete substring.\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If* `good == distinct` : every character with positive frequency has\n`freq == k` (definition of `good`). No character occurs a different\nnumber of times, therefore the window satisfies the first requirement.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 it also satisfies the second one, i.e. it is complete.\n\n*Only‑if* the window is complete : by definition each occurring character\nappears exactly `k` times, therefore it contributes to `good`. All\ncharacters with `freq > 0` are counted in `distinct`. Hence the two\nnumbers are equal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nWhenever the algorithm increments the answer, the substring `[L … R]`\nhas not been counted before.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe right border `R` is processed only once.\nWhen the answer is increased, the current left border is the **smallest**\npossible index that keeps all frequencies ≤ k (otherwise the `while`\nloop would have moved it further left).  \nAny earlier left border `L' < L` would give a window `[L' … R]` with some\ncharacter count > k, contradicting Lemma&nbsp;2.  \nThus the pair `(L,R)` is unique for this complete substring. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nEvery complete substring of a block is counted exactly once.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake an arbitrary complete substring `s = word[i … j]` inside the block.\nWhile scanning, when `R = j` the algorithm has already added all\ncharacters up to `j`.  \nBecause `s` is complete, all its character counts are `k`, therefore\n`freq ≤ k` holds for the whole window `[i … j]`.  \nThe `while` loop never moves `L` past `i`, otherwise some character of\n`s` would become `< k` and the window could not be complete.\nConsequently after the loop finishes we have `L = i`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 `good == distinct`, so the algorithm increments the\nanswer for this `(L,R)`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 this is the only moment `s` is counted. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 6  \nThe total answer returned by the algorithm equals the number of complete\nsubstrings of the original word.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 a substring of the original word is complete **iff**\nit lies completely inside one of the blocks and is complete inside that\nblock.  \nThe algorithm processes each block independently and, by Lemma&nbsp;5,\ncounts exactly the complete substrings belonging to that block.\nSummation over all blocks therefore yields the exact total number. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`countCompleteSubstrings` returns the number of substrings of `word`\nthat satisfy both given conditions.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm first splits `word` into maximal blocks where the adjacent\ndifference condition holds.  \nFor each block it runs the linear scan described above.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;6 the sum of the counts obtained from all blocks equals the\ndesired number of complete substrings. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

The array sick contains the positions of the children who are infected with an infectious disease. An infected child at position i can spread the disease to either of its immediate neighboring children at positions i - 1 and i + 1 if they exist and are currently not infected. At most one child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.\nIt can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get infected with the disease. An infection sequence is the sequential order of positions in which all of the non-infected children get infected with the disease. Return the total number of possible infection sequences.\nSince the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.\nNote that an infection sequence does not contain positions of children who were already infected with the disease in the beginning.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 5, sick = [0,4]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Children at positions 1, 2, and 3 are not infected in the beginning. There are 4 possible infection sequences:\n- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected since their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.\nNow, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 2 gets infected.\nFinally, the child at position 3 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 2 and 4 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,2,3].\n- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected because their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.\nNow, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 3 gets infected.\nFinally, the child at position 2 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 1 and 3 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,3,2].\n- The infection sequence is [3,1,2].

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns exactly the number of possible\ninfection sequences.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor an inner block of length `L ≥ 1` the number of admissible infection\norders **restricted to this block** equals `2^{L-1}`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAt any moment the only children that can be infected are the current\nleftmost and rightmost healthy children of the block (all inner children\nhave a healthy neighbour on both sides).  \nThus we have a binary choice for each infection step while at least two\nchildren remain, i.e. for the first `L‑1` steps.  \nThe last remaining child has no choice.  \nTherefore the total number of orders is `2^{L-1}`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a left (or right) block the infection order is unique.\n\n**Proof.**  \nOnly the neighbour that is already infected lies on one side of the\nblock. Consequently the only child that is adjacent to an infected one\nis the one closest to that neighbour. After it becomes infected the next\nclosest child becomes the only possible candidate, and so on. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nLet the block sizes be `L1,…,Lk`.  \nIf each block `i` can be infected in `C_i` different internal orders,\nthe total number of global infection sequences equals  \n\n```\n   m! / (L1!·…·Lk!)  ·  (C1·…·Ck) .\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider a concrete global sequence.\nDelete from it the actual positions, keeping only the *block identifier*\n(`i`) of each infected child.  \nWe obtain a word of length `m` that contains exactly `Li` copies of the\nsymbol `i`.  \nConversely, any such word tells us **when** a child from each block is\ninfected, but not **which** child.  \n\n*Step 1 – interleaving.*  \nThe number of different words with the prescribed multiplicities is the\nmultinomial coefficient `m!/(L1!·…·Lk!)`.\n\n*Step 2 – internal order.*  \nFor each block `i` we must replace the `Li` occurrences of its symbol by\na concrete admissible order of its children.

How many distinct values can we keep?\n\n*From the exclusive parts*  \n\nWe can keep at most `n/2` values from each side, therefore\n\n```\nkeep1 = min( |exclusive1| , n/2 )      # distinct values taken from exclusive1\nkeep2 = min( |exclusive2| , n/2 )      # distinct values taken from exclusive2\n```\n\nThe remaining free slots in the two arrays are\n\n```\nfree1 = n/2 - keep1          # still unused positions in nums1\nfree2 = n/2 - keep2          # still unused positions in nums2\ntotalFree = free1 + free2    # total number of slots we may still fill\n```\n\n*From the common part*  \n\nEvery common value needs **one** free slot (from any side).  \nConsequently we can add at most `min( |common| , totalFree )` new distinct\nvalues.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Final formula  \n\n```\nanswer = keep1 + keep2 + min( |common| , totalFree )\n```\n\nAll constraints are satisfied:\n\n* `keep1 + free1 = n/2` and `keep2 + free2 = n/2` – exactly `n/2` kept elements\n  per array.\n* We never keep more distinct values than there are slots for them.\n* Adding duplicates to fill the remaining slots never changes the set size,\n  therefore the formula indeed yields the **maximum** possible size.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum possible size of `s`.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nIn an optimal solution each kept distinct value is stored at most once\n(either in `nums1` or in `nums2`).\n\n**Proof.**  \nIf a value appears in both kept halves, removing one of its copies frees a\nslot while the set size stays unchanged. The freed slot can be used for a\ndifferent value (if any exists) and never decreases the answer. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nLet `x` be the number of distinct values taken from `exclusive1` in any feasible\nsolution. Then `x ≤ min(|exclusive1|, n/2)`. The same holds for `exclusive2`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nOnly values of `exclusive1` can be stored in `nums1`. There are `|exclusive1|`\ndifferent such values, so `x ≤ |exclusive1|`.  \n`nums1` can keep only `n/2` elements, therefore `x ≤ n/2`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nAfter fixing the numbers `x` (from `exclusive1`) and `y` (from `exclusive2`),\nthe maximum number of distinct common values that can be added equals  \n`min( |common| , (n/2 - x) + (n/2 - y) )`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nEach common value needs exactly one free slot, either in `nums1` or in\n`nums2`. After keeping `x` exclusive values in `nums1` we have `n/2 - x`\nfree slots there, similarly `n/2 - y` in `nums2`. Altogether\n`(n/2 - x) + (n/2 - y)` slots are available. We cannot add more common values\nthan the number of distinct common values `|common|`. Hence the bound is the\nminimum of the two numbers, and it is reachable by assigning each common value\nto any still free slot. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor any feasible solution the size of its set `s` is at most  \n\n```\nkeep1 + keep2 + min( |common| , totalFree )\n```\n\nwhere `keep1 = min(|exclusive1|, n/2)`, `keep2 = min(|exclusive2|, n/2)`,\n`totalFree = n - (keep1 + keep2)`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake any feasible solution and let `x` and `y` be the numbers of distinct\nexclusive values it keeps (by Lemma&nbsp;2, `x ≤ keep1` and `y ≤ keep2`).  \nThe number of distinct common values it can keep is bounded by Lemma&nbsp;3,\ni.e. at most `min(|common|, (n/2 - x)+(n/2 - y))`.  \nSince `x ≤ keep1` and `y ≤ keep2`, the available free slots satisfy  \n\n```\n(n/2 - x)+(n/2 - y) ≤ (n/2 - keep1)+(n/2 - keep2) = totalFree .\n```\n\nTherefore the total distinct count of the solution is  \n\n```\nx + y + min(|common|, (n/2 - x)+(n/2 - y))\n≤ keep1 + keep2 + min(|common|, totalFree) .\n```\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nThe algorithm constructs a feasible solution whose set size equals  \n\n```\nkeep1 + keep2 + min( |common| , totalFree )\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \n* Keep `keep1` arbitrary distinct values from `exclusive1` in `nums1`\n  (possible because `keep1 ≤ n/2`).\n* Keep `keep2` arbitrary distinct values from `exclusive2` in `nums2`\n  (possible because `keep2 ≤ n/2`).\n* There remain exactly `totalFree` free slots (`free1 + free2`).  \n  Take `z = min(|common|, totalFree)` distinct values from `common` and put\n  each of them into any still free slot (first fill `nums1`, then `nums2` if\n  needed).  \n  After that both arrays contain exactly `n/2` elements, so the construction\n  is feasible and the set size is `keep1 + keep2 + z`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`answer` returned by the algorithm is the maximum possible size of the set `s`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 no feasible solution can have a set larger than the value\ncomputed by the algorithm.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;5 the algorithm achieves exactly this value with a feasible\nchoice of deletions.  \nHence the algorithm’s result is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Any later coin is ≥ `coins[i] > miss`.  \nTherefore no existing coin can create the sum `miss`. To make `miss`\nobtainable we must introduce a new coin `c ≤ miss`. The smallest such value\nis `miss` itself, and using a larger one cannot reduce the number of added\ncoins (it would still leave `miss` uncovered). ∎\n\n\n\n**Lemma 4** (Optimality of the greedy step)  \nWhen `coins[i] > miss`, adding a coin of value `miss` is part of some optimal\nsolution.\n\n*Proof.*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 any optimal solution must add a coin `c ≤ miss`.  \nIf `c < miss`, replace it by `miss`; the set of obtainable sums can only\nincrease, never decrease, so the solution stays feasible with the same\nnumber of added coins. Hence there exists an optimal solution that adds\nexactly `miss`. ∎\n\n\n\n**Theorem**  \nThe algorithm outputs the minimum possible number of coins that need to be\nadded so that every integer in `[1, target]` is obtainable.\n\n*Proof.*  \nWe show by induction over the loop iterations that after each iteration\nthe algorithm has used the minimum possible number of added coins to make\nall sums `< miss` obtainable.\n\n*Base.* Before the first iteration `miss = 1`; zero added coins is clearly\noptimal.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nTwo cases:\n\n1. **Use existing coin (`coins[i] ≤ miss`).**  \n   No new coin is added, so the number of added coins stays optimal.\n   The reachable interval expands exactly as any solution that also uses\n   this coin can (by Lemma&nbsp;1), thus optimality is preserved.\n\n2. **Add a patch (`coins[i] > miss` or no coin left).**  \n   By Lemma&nbsp;4 there exists an optimal solution that adds a coin of\n   value `miss`. The algorithm does exactly that, increasing the count by\n   one, which matches the optimal count for the new interval\n   `[1, 2·miss)`. Hence optimality is preserved.\n\nThus after each iteration the algorithm has the minimal possible number of\nadded coins for the current `miss`.

Since `x` only ever increases, it is\nalways `≥ pref_sum`. ∎\n\n\n\n*Lemma 3*  \nNo integer `y` with `pref_sum ≤ y < x` is missing from `nums`.\n\n*Proof.*  \nAssume there exists such a `y`. While the loop was running, it examined every\ninteger from `pref_sum` up to (but not including) `x`. Because it would have\nstopped at the first missing integer, encountering `y` would have caused the\nloop to terminate earlier, contradicting the fact that it terminated at `x`. ∎\n\n\n\n*Theorem*  \nThe algorithm returns the smallest integer `x` that is missing from `nums` and\nsatisfies `x ≥ sum(longest sequential prefix)`.\n\n*Proof.*  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1, `pref_sum` is exactly the required lower bound.  \nLemma&nbsp;2 guarantees that the returned `x` is missing and respects the lower\nbound. Lemma&nbsp;3 shows that no smaller integer meeting the lower bound is\nmissing. Hence `x` is precisely the smallest integer satisfying the problem\nstatement. ∎\n\n\n\n---\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\n*Time*:  \n- First loop scans the array once → `O(n)`  \n- Building the set → `O(n)`  \n- Second loop may advance at most `n+max(nums)` steps, but with `n ≤ 50` and\n  values ≤ 50 this is bounded by a constant; in the worst case it is `O(n)`.  \nOverall `O(n)`.\n\n*Space*:  \n- The hash set stores at most `n` elements → `O(n)` extra space.\n\nWith the given constraints (`n ≤ 50`) this easily fits the limits.\n\n---\n\n#### Reference Implementation (Python 3)\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def missingInteger(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # 1.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the required number of powerful\nintegers.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed total length `t = L + p` (`p ≥ 0`) the set of powerful\nintegers of that length is exactly the set  \n\n```\n{  (prefix)·10^{L} + value(s) |\n   prefix is a decimal string of length p,\n   every digit of prefix ≤ limit,\n   first digit of prefix ≠ 0  (if p>0) }\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy definition a powerful integer ends with `s`. Removing the last `L`\ndigits leaves a (possibly empty) prefix. All remaining digits belong to\nthe prefix, therefore they must satisfy the digit‑limit condition and\nthe first digit cannot be zero (otherwise the whole number would have a\nleading zero). Conversely, any such prefix concatenated with `s` obviously\nhas `s` as suffix and respects the digit limit. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed `p>0` the number of *all* candidates of length `L+p`\n(ignoring any upper bound) equals  \n\n```\ncnt(p) = limit * (limit+1)^{p-1}\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe first digit can be any of `1 … limit` → `limit` choices.\nEach of the remaining `p‑1` positions can be any of `0 … limit`\n→ `limit+1` choices each.\nMultiplying gives the formula. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nLet `N` have `n = L + p` digits.\nAmong the candidates of length `n`\n\n* the number of candidates whose prefix is **strictly smaller**\n  than `boundPrefix` equals `less` (the DP result),\n* the number of candidates whose prefix is **exactly equal**\n  to `boundPrefix` and the whole number does not exceed `N`\n  equals `equal` (the DP result).\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe DP enumerates *all* strings of length `p` that satisfy the digit\nrestriction and the “no leading zero” rule.\n\n*If the DP is in a *tight* state after processing the whole prefix,\nthe built prefix equals `boundPrefix`.  \nThe DP counts exactly one such prefix (or zero if it is illegal).  \nThe whole number is ≤ `N` precisely when the suffix `s` does not exceed\n`boundSuffix`. The algorithm adds `1` in this case, otherwise `0`. *\n\n*If the DP ever chooses a digit smaller than the bound digit while still\ntight, it switches to the *loose* state and stays there.\nAll strings that end in the *loose* state are exactly the prefixes that\nare lexicographically smaller than `boundPrefix`. The DP counts them in\n`less`.* ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor any bound `N` the function `F(N)` computed by the algorithm equals\nthe number of powerful integers `x` with `1 ≤ x ≤ N`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider three disjoint groups of powerful integers:\n\n1. **Length `< len(N)`**  \n   For each possible length `t = L + p` (`L ≤ t < len(N)`) the algorithm\n   adds:\n   * `1` if `p = 0` (the single number `s`);\n   * `cnt(p)` if `p > 0`.  \n   By Lemma&nbsp;2 `cnt(p)` is exactly the number of candidates of that\n   length, and because the length is smaller than `len(N)`, every such\n   candidate is ≤ `N`. Hence the contribution equals the exact count of\n   powerful integers of those lengths.\n\n2. **Length `= len(N)` and `p = 0`**  \n   The only possible number is `s`. The algorithm adds `1` iff `s ≤ N`,\n   which is precisely the correct count.\n\n3. **Length `= len(N)` and `p > 0`**  \n   By Lemma&nbsp;3 the algorithm adds `less + equal`, which is exactly\n   the number of candidates of this length that do not exceed `N`.\n\nAll powerful integers belong to exactly one of the three groups, and the\nalgorithm adds the exact size of each group.

Consider rectangle `k+1` with values `diag, area`.\n\n- If `diag > best_diag`, the new rectangle has a strictly larger diagonal than any previous one (by Lemma 1). The algorithm updates `best_diag` to `diag` and `best_area` to `area`, so the invariant holds.\n- If `diag == best_diag`, the diagonal ties the current maximum. The algorithm keeps `best_diag` unchanged and updates `best_area` only when `area` is larger, thus preserving that `best_area` is the maximal area among rectangles with diagonal `best_diag`.\n- If `diag < best_diag`, nothing changes, and the invariant obviously remains true.\n\nThus the invariant holds after processing `k+1` rectangles. ∎\n\n*Theorem*  \nAfter the loop finishes, `best_area` is the area of the rectangle with the longest diagonal; if several rectangles share that longest diagonal, `best_area` is the largest area among them.  \n*Proof.* By Lemma 2 with all `n` rectangles processed, `best_diag` is the maximum diagonal squared over the whole input, i.e. the longest diagonal (Lemma 1). `best_area` is the maximal area among rectangles whose diagonal squared equals this maximum, exactly the required tie‑breaking rule.

For `i > 0`,\n`pref[i]` is set to `pref[i-1]` **and** `nums[i] > nums[i-1]`.  \nThus `pref[i]` holds exactly when all previous adjacent pairs are strictly\nincreasing and the new pair `(i‑1,i)` is also increasing – i.e. the whole\nprefix is strictly increasing. The argument for `suf` is symmetric. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed subarray `[l … r]` the three boolean checks\n\n* `left_ok`\n* `right_ok`\n* `bridge_ok`\n\nare all `True` **iff** the array obtained after deleting `[l … r]` is strictly\nincreasing.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If the three checks are true.*\n\n* `left_ok` guarantees (by Lemma&nbsp;1) that the left part `nums[0 … l‑1]`\n  is strictly increasing (or empty).\n* `right_ok` guarantees the same for the right part `nums[r+1 … n‑1]`.\n* If both parts are non‑empty, `bridge_ok` asserts\n  `nums[l‑1] < nums[r+1]`, i.e. the last element of the left part is smaller\n  than the first element of the right part. Consequently the concatenation\n  `left + right` has every adjacent pair strictly increasing, so the whole\n  remaining array is strictly increasing.\n\n*If the remaining array is strictly increasing.*\n\nBoth `left` and `right` (if they exist) must be strictly increasing, otherwise\nthe concatenated array would contain a non‑increasing adjacent pair.\nHence `left_ok` and `right_ok` are true (Lemma&nbsp;1).  \nIf both parts exist, the element at the border of the concatenation must also\nsatisfy the strict inequality, therefore `bridge_ok` holds. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe algorithm counts a subarray `[l … r]` **iff** it is incremovable.\n\n**Proof.** The algorithm increments the answer exactly when the three checks\nare all true. By Lemma&nbsp;2 this is equivalent to the remaining array being\nstrictly increasing, i.e. to `[l … r]` being incremovable. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`incremovableSubarrayCount` returns the total number of incremovable subarrays\nof `nums`.\n\n**Proof.** The algorithm iterates over **all** non‑empty subarrays of `nums`.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 it adds one to the answer precisely for those that are\nincremovable.

When is a value `X` achievable ?\n\nWe ask: *Is it possible to obtain a final OR not larger than `X` ?*  \nThat means every kept block‑AND must contain only bits that are also set\nin `X`.\n\n```\nblock AND  ⊆  X          ⇔          (block AND) & (~X) == 0          (2)\n```\n\nFor a fixed `X` we have to cover the whole array with blocks that satisfy\n(2) and use **no more than `k` operations**.\nIf the *minimum* number of operations needed for this is `need`,\n`X` is feasible iff `need ≤ k`.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.   Minimal number of operations for a given `X`\n\nThe cost of a block is its length minus one, i.e. the longer the block,\nthe more operations we spend.\nTherefore we should make every block **as short as possible** while still\nfulfilling (2).  \nA greedy left‑to‑right scan does exactly that:\n\n```\ni = 0\nwhile i < n\n        cur = nums[i]                     # AND of the current block\n        if cur already fits into X:\n                i += 1                     # block of length 1, no cost\n                continue\n        # enlarge the block until it fits\n        j = i\n        while j+1 < n:\n                j += 1\n                cur &= nums[j]\n                if cur fits into X: break\n        if cur still does NOT fit:   impossible → return False\n        operations += (j - i)          # length-1\n        i = j + 1\n        if operations > k: return False\nreturn True\n```\n\n*Why is the greedy choice optimal?*  \nAssume an optimal solution starts with a block `[i … r]`.  \nIf `r` is **not** the smallest index that already satisfies (2), we can\nreplace it by the shorter block `[i … r']` (`r' < r`).  \nAll later blocks stay unchanged, the total number of operations only\ndecreases. Repeating this argument for every block transforms any optimal\nsolution into the greedy one, therefore the greedy construction indeed\nuses the **minimum possible number of operations**.\n\nThe scan moves each pointer only forward – overall `O(n)` time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Searching the minimum possible OR\n\nAll numbers are `< 2³⁰`, so the answer fits into 30 bits.\nWe build the answer bit by bit from the most significant to the least\nsignificant one.\n\n```\nans = 0\nfor b from 29 down to 0\n        # try to keep this bit 0, lower bits may be anything (set to 1)\n        candidate = ans | ((1 << b) - 1)\n        if feasible(candidate):          # greedy test described above\n                # bit b can stay 0\n                continue\n        else:\n                ans |= (1 << b)           # we must set it to 1\nreturn ans\n```\n\nWhen we test `candidate`, all higher bits are already fixed,\nthe current bit is forced to `0`,\nand all lower bits are allowed (`1`) – if a solution exists under this\nrestriction we keep the bit `0`, otherwise we have to set it to `1`.\n\nThe loop runs 30 times, each feasibility test is `O(n)`,\nso the total complexity is `O(30·n) = O(n)` with a small constant.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible final OR.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed value `X` the greedy scan described in Section&nbsp;3 uses the\nminimum possible number of operations among all partitions whose block‑ANDs\nare subsets of `X`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nConsider the leftmost block of an arbitrary optimal partition, covering\nindices `[l … r]`.  \nLet `r₀` be the smallest index `≥ l` such that the AND of\n`nums[l … r₀]` already satisfies (2).  \nBecause AND is monotone (adding elements can only clear bits),\n`r₀ ≤ r`.  \nReplace the original block by the shorter block `[l … r₀]`.  \nAll later blocks still start at `r₀+1`, therefore the total number of\noperations (sum of lengths‑1) does **not increase**; it actually decreases\nby `(r‑r₀)`.  \nRepeating this argument for every block transforms the optimal partition\ninto the greedy one without increasing the operation count.\nHence the greedy construction is optimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a value `X` the feasibility test (`can(X)`) returns *True*  \niff there exists a sequence of at most `k` operations whose final OR is\n≤ `X`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If part.*  \n`can(X)` builds a partition where every block‑AND ⊆ `X` and the total\noperations used are `ops ≤ k`.  \nMerging each block exactly as the partition describes yields a final\narray consisting of those block‑ANDs, whose OR is also a subset of `X`,\nhence ≤ `X`. The number of performed operations equals `ops ≤ k`.\n\n*Only‑if part.*  \nAssume a sequence of ≤ `k` operations leads to a final array with OR ≤ `X`.  \nThe performed merges define a partition of the original array into blocks,\neach block being the set of original elements that finally became one\nelement.  \nEvery block‑AND is a part of the final OR, therefore it is a subset of `X`.\nThe number of operations equals `n – (#blocks) ≤ k`, i.e. the partition\nneeds at most `k` operations.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 the greedy scan needs **no more** operations than this\npartition, consequently `can(X)` will also succeed and return *True*. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nDuring the bit‑by‑bit construction, after processing bits higher than `b`,\nthe variable `ans` equals the minimum possible value of the final OR\nrestricted to those higher bits.\n\n**Proof.**  \nInduction over the loop.\n\n*Base.* Before any iteration no bits are fixed; the statement is vacuously\ntrue.\n\n*Induction step.*  \nAssume the statement holds after handling bits `> b`.  \nWe now try to keep bit `b` equal to `0`.  \n`candidate = ans | ((1<<b)-1)` allows any pattern for lower bits while\nforcing bit `b` to `0`.  \n\n- If `can(candidate)` is *True*, by Lemma&nbsp;2 there exists a solution\n  whose OR respects the current higher bits (`ans`), has bit `b = 0`,\n  and arbitrary lower bits. Hence the minimum achievable value with the\n  already fixed higher bits also has bit `b = 0`; we keep `ans` unchanged.\n\n- If `can(candidate)` is *False*, no solution can have bit `b = 0`\n  together with the already fixed higher bits. Consequently every feasible\n  final OR must have bit `b = 1`. We set this bit in `ans`.\n\nThus after the iteration `ans` is the smallest possible value for the\nalready processed bits. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nWhen the loop finishes, `ans` is the minimum possible final OR over **all**\nbits.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAfter the last iteration (`b = 0`) all 30 bits have been processed.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 `ans` is the smallest value achievable with the fixed\nbits, i.e. with all bits fixed. Therefore no other feasible final OR is\nsmaller than `ans`, and `ans` itself is feasible (the last feasibility\ncheck that kept a bit `0` guarantees existence). ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minOrAfterOperations(nums, k)` returns the minimum possible value of the\nbitwise OR of the array after performing at most `k` allowed operations.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm returns the variable `ans` produced by the bit‑by‑bit loop.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 this `ans` is exactly the smallest achievable final OR.\nHence the method is correct. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.   Complexity Analysis  \n\n*Feasibility test* (`can(X)`) : one linear scan → `O(n)` time, `O(1)` extra\nmemory.\n\n*Main algorithm* : 30 iterations × `O(n)` → `O(30·n) = O(n)` time,\n`O(1)` additional memory.\n\n`n ≤ 10⁵`, so the program easily fits into the limits.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.

The polygon existence condition for a set of\nside lengths is exactly that the largest side is smaller than the sum of the rest.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf a suffix `S` satisfies the polygon condition, then any larger suffix\n`S' = b_j … b_{n-1}` with `j < i` (i.e. `S'` contains `S` and some additional,\nstill larger numbers) **does not** satisfy the condition.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`S'` has a larger longest side `b_j ≥ b_i` while the sum of the remaining sides\nis at most `sum(S)`.

The polygon’s perimeter is at most the sum of the whole\nsuffix `b_{i*} … b_{n-1}`, i.e. at most `P*`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm stops exactly at index `i*` (or determines that no such index\nexists).\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe loop removes the current longest side while the polygon condition is false.\nThus after each iteration the remaining numbers are the suffix starting at the\nnext index. The loop terminates when the condition becomes true, i.e. at the\nfirst index where it holds – precisely `i*`.

Setting `p = i+1` and `q = j+1`\ngives the formula above. ∎\n\n\n\n*Lemma 2*  \nAmong all pairs `(p,q)` with `1 ≤ p < q ≤ n‑1`, the minimum of\n`nums[p] + nums[q]` is obtained by the two smallest values in the suffix\n`nums[1:]`.\n\n*Proof.* Let `a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ …` be the values of the suffix sorted increasingly.\nFor any pair `(p,q)` the sum is at least `a + b`, because both summands are\nelements of the suffix and the smallest possible choices are `a` and `b`.\nChoosing the positions of `a` and `b` (they exist, possibly at the same value\nif it appears twice) yields the sum `a + b`. Hence `a + b` is the minimum. ∎\n\n\n\n*Lemma 3*  \nThe algorithm returns `nums[0] + a + b`, where `a` and `b` are the two\nsmallest values of the suffix.\n\n*Proof.* Step 3 of the algorithm explicitly finds those two values, and step 4\nadds `nums[0]`. ∎\n\n\n\n*Theorem*  \nThe algorithm returns the minimum possible total cost of dividing `nums` into\nthree contiguous non‑empty subarrays.\n\n*Proof.*  \nBy Lemma 1 any split has cost `nums[0] + nums[p] + nums[q]` for some valid\n`p,q`. By Lemma 2 the smallest achievable value of `nums[p] + nums[q]` is\n`a + b`, the sum of the two smallest suffix elements. Lemma 3 shows that the\nalgorithm returns exactly `nums[0] + a + b`.

When can we make it equal to `S` ?\n\nWe are free to choose every `Ai`, therefore we can choose `T` arbitrarily.\nEquation (1) must become `S`.\n\n*Case 1 – the window still touches the original part* (`t·k ≤ n`)  \n\n```\n(S + T)[t·k … t·k+n-1] =  S[t·k … n-1]  +  T[0 … n - t·k - 1]\n```\n\nThe right part (`T[ … ]`) can be set to anything, but the left part is already\nfixed: it is the suffix `S[t·k … n-1]`.  \nFor the whole substring to be exactly `S` we need the **prefix** of `S`\nto be identical to that suffix:\n\n```\nS[0 … n - t·k - 1]   ==   S[t·k … n-1]                (2)\n```\n\nIf (2) holds we simply choose the first `n‑t·k` characters of `T`\nto be `S[0 … n-t·k-1]` and the whole window becomes `S`.\n\n*Case 2 – the window lies completely inside the added part* (`t·k > n`)  \n\nNow the start of the window is already past the original string,\nso the whole window is taken from `T`.  \nBecause we can fill `T` with any characters, we can always make the window\nequal to `S`.  \nTherefore **any** `t` with `t·k ≥ n` works, and the smallest such `t` is  \n\n```\nceil(n / k)\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 3.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns exactly the minimum required time.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a given `t` with `t·k ≤ n` the string can be restored to `S` after `t`\nseconds **iff** condition (2) holds:\n`S[0 … n‑t·k‑1] = S[t·k … n‑1]`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFrom the sliding‑window view (1) we have after `t` seconds  \n\n```\ncurrent = S[t·k … n-1]  +  T[0 … n - t·k - 1]          (3)\n```\n\n`T` is under our control, the first part is fixed.\nIf (2) holds we set `T[0 … n‑t·k‑1]` to `S[0 … n‑t·k‑1]` and (3) becomes `S`.  \nConversely, if (2) does **not** hold, the left part of (3) differs from the\ncorresponding prefix of `S`, and no choice of `T` can fix it. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf `t·k > n` then we can always restore the string after `t` seconds.\n\n**Proof.**  \nNow the window (1) starts after the original block `S`, i.e. it lies completely\ninside `T`.  \nWe simply fill `T` so that the segment `T[t·k‑n … t·k‑n + n‑1]` equals `S`.\nAll other characters of `T` are irrelevant. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nLet `t*` be the smallest positive integer satisfying either  \n\n* `t·k ≤ n` and (2) holds, or  \n* `t·k > n`.\n\nThen `t*` is the minimum time needed to return to the initial state.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*Existence*: By Lemma&nbsp;2 any `t ≥ ceil(n/k)` works, therefore such a `t*`\nexists.  \n\n*Optimality*:  \n- If `t*·k ≤ n`, Lemma&nbsp;1 shows that restoration is possible exactly at\n  `t*`. For any smaller `t` the condition (2) is false, thus restoration is\n  impossible.\n- If `t*·k > n`, then `t* = ceil(n/k)`. Any `t < t*` satisfies `t·k ≤ n`,\n  and because `t*` is the first integer with `t·k > n`, all smaller `t`\n  fail the condition (2) (otherwise the algorithm would have returned that\n  smaller `t`). Hence restoration is impossible earlier.\n\nThus no smaller number of seconds works, and `t*` is minimal. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm returns exactly `t*`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm iterates `t = 1,2,…` :\n\n* If `t·k ≤ n` it checks condition (2) and returns the first `t` for which it\n  holds – this is precisely the smallest `t` of the first kind.\n* If `t·k > n` it returns `t` immediately – this is the smallest `t` of the\n  second kind (`ceil(n/k)`).\n\nTherefore the returned value equals the definition of `t*`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`minimumTimeToInitialState` returns the minimum positive number of seconds\nafter which the given word can become equal to its initial state.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm returns `t*`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 `t*` is exactly the minimal feasible time. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the size of the largest subset that\ncan be arranged in the required pattern.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor a fixed base `x` and a fixed exponent set `E = [1,2,4,8,16]` a\npattern of length `2·i+1` can be built **iff**  \n\n```\ncnt[0] ≥ 2 , cnt[1] ≥ 2 , … , cnt[i‑1] ≥ 2   and   cnt[i] ≥ 1 .\n```\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe pattern uses the numbers `x^{e0}, x^{e1}, … , x^{ei}`.\nAll exponents except the largest appear twice (left and right side),\nhence at least two copies are necessary – the first condition.\nThe largest exponent appears once, therefore at least one copy is\nnecessary – the second condition.\nConversely, if the conditions hold we can take exactly two copies of\neach `x^{ej}` (`j<i`) and one copy of `x^{ei}` and place them in the\nrequired order, obtaining a valid pattern of length `2·i+1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nFor a fixed base `x` the algorithm computes the maximum possible length\nobtainable with that base.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm scans the exponents in increasing order.\n`ok` is true exactly while all previously inspected exponents satisfy\n`cnt ≥ 2`.  \nWhen `ok` is true and the current exponent has `cnt ≥ 1`,\nby Lemma&nbsp;1 a pattern of length `2·i+1` is feasible, therefore the\nalgorithm records this length.\nIf `cnt[i] < 2` the condition for any larger exponent fails\n(because a required previous exponent would have fewer than two copies),\nso `ok` becomes false and no longer lengths are considered.\nThus every feasible length is examined and the maximum among them is\nstored. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nFor every base `x` the dictionary `cnt` built by the algorithm contains\nthe exact multiplicity of each power `x^{e}` (`e∈E`) present in the input\narray.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFor each input number `v` the algorithm tries every exponent `e∈E`.\nIf `v = x^{e}` for some integer `x`, the integer root routine returns\nthat `x` and the equality test succeeds, incrementing `cnt[x][e]`.\nIf `v` cannot be written as a power with exponent `e`, the test fails\nand the counter is not changed.\nSince every representation `v = x^{e}` with `e∈E` is examined exactly once,\nthe final counter equals the number of occurrences of that power in\n`nums`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nFor any subset `S` of `nums` that can be arranged in the required pattern,\nlet `x` be its base and let `i` be the index of its largest exponent.\nThen the algorithm will consider base `x` and will obtain a length at\nleast `|S|`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll elements of `S` are of the form `x^{e}` with `e∈E`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;3 the counters for base `x` contain at least the\nmultiplicities of those elements, therefore for every exponent `e_j`\nwith `j<i` we have `cnt[j] ≥ 2` (two copies are needed in the pattern)\nand `cnt[i] ≥ 1`.  \nConsequently the condition of Lemma&nbsp;1 holds, the algorithm will\nrecognise length `2·i+1 = |S|` as feasible and will keep a value not\nsmaller than `|S|`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nThe answer returned by the algorithm is **not smaller** than the size of\nany feasible subset.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake an arbitrary feasible subset `S`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm, when processing its base `x`, records a\nlength at least `|S|`.  \nThe global answer is the maximum over all bases, therefore it is at\nleast `|S|`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 6  \nThe answer returned by the algorithm is **feasible**, i.e. there exists\na subset of that size that can be arranged in the required pattern.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm chooses a base `x` and an index `i` that gave the maximal\nrecorded length `L = 2·i+1`.  \nFor this base the counters satisfy the condition of Lemma&nbsp;1\n(because the algorithm only records a length when the condition holds).\nHence we can take two copies of each `x^{e_j}` (`j<i`) and one copy of\n`x^{e_i}` – all of them are present in the original array – and obtain a\nvalid pattern of length `L`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`maximumLength` returns the maximum possible number of elements that can\nbe selected from `nums` and arranged in the pattern  \n`[x, x², x⁴, …, x^{k/2}, x^{k}, x^{k/2}, …, x⁴, x², x]`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*Upper bound*: By Lemma&nbsp;5 the algorithm’s answer is at least as large\nas any feasible subset, therefore it cannot be smaller than the optimum.\n*Achievability*: By Lemma&nbsp;6 the algorithm’s answer corresponds to an\nexplicitly constructible feasible subset, therefore it cannot be larger\nthan the optimum.\nBoth bounds coincide, so the returned value equals the optimum. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.

The only still present copy is the\n`maxCnt`‑th (last) occurrence, which will be deleted in the final operation.\n\nThus the set of characters that survive until just before operation `maxCnt`\nis precisely the described one. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nDuring the left‑to‑right scan the algorithm appends a character `c`\niff it is the `maxCnt`‑th occurrence of a letter whose total count equals\n`maxCnt`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n`seen[c]` counts how many copies of `c` have been encountered so far.\nWhen the scan reaches the `maxCnt`‑th occurrence, `seen[c]` becomes `maxCnt`.\nThe algorithm checks the two conditions:\n\n* `seen[c] == maxCnt` – true exactly for the `maxCnt`‑th occurrence,\n* `cnt[c] == maxCnt` – true exactly for letters whose total frequency equals\n  `maxCnt`.\n\nBoth hold **iff** the current character satisfies the description,\nso the algorithm appends it exactly in that case. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nThe string built by the algorithm is the characters that exist right before the\nlast operation, in the original order.\n\n**Proof.**  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm appends precisely the characters identified in\nLemma&nbsp;3, and it processes the original string from left to right, therefore\nthe relative order of those characters is unchanged. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`lastNonEmptyString(s)` returned by the algorithm equals the value of `s`\nimmediately before the final operation of the described process.\n\n**Proof.**  \nFrom Lemma&nbsp;2 the final operation is operation `maxCnt`.  \nLemma&nbsp;5 shows that the algorithm outputs exactly the characters that are\npresent just before that operation, preserving their order.\nHence the returned string is the required one. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

Reducing the problem\n\nWe have a capacity `totalPairs`.  \nEach word consumes `needPairs[w]` units of this capacity and gives us\n`+1` palindrome.\n\nAll values are **positive integers** (or zero) and the profit of every\nitem is the same (`1`).  \nThe optimal strategy is therefore greedy:\n\n* sort all `needPairs` increasingly,\n* take words while the accumulated sum does not exceed `totalPairs`.\n\nThis yields the maximum possible number of palindromes.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.   Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm returns the maximum achievable number of\npalindromes.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nA set of words can be turned into palindromes **iff** the sum of their\n`needPairs` does not exceed `totalPairs`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n*If* the sum `P` of required pairs is ≤ `totalPairs`, we can allocate\nexactly `needPairs[w]` pairs of equal letters to each word (the pool\ncontains at least `totalPairs` such pairs).  \nAll remaining characters (including the unused pairs, each of which can be\nsplit into two singles) are enough to fill the centre positions of the odd\nlength words, because the total number of used characters equals the total\nlength of the selected words, which is ≤ the total number of characters.\n\n*Only‑if* the sum of required pairs were larger than `totalPairs`, we would\nneed more equal‑letter pairs than exist in the whole pool – impossible.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nAmong all subsets of words whose total `needPairs` ≤ `totalPairs`,\nthe greedy algorithm (taking smallest `needPairs` first) yields a subset\nwith the largest cardinality.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAll items have the same value (`1`).  \nConsider any optimal subset `S`.  \nSort the whole list of `needPairs` as `a₁ ≤ a₂ ≤ … ≤ a_n`.  \nLet the greedy algorithm pick the first `k` items, i.e. `{a₁,…,a_k}`.\nAssume `|S| > k`.  \nTake the `k+1`‑st smallest element `a_{k+1}`.  \nBecause the greedy algorithm stopped,  \n\n```\na₁ + … + a_k + a_{k+1} > totalPairs          (1)\n```\n\nAll elements of `S` are taken from the same sorted list, therefore at\nleast `k+1` of them are ≥ `a₁,…,a_{k+1}`.  \nConsequently the sum of any `k+1` elements of `S` is ≥ the left side of\n(1) and thus exceeds `totalPairs`, contradicting Lemma&nbsp;1.\nHence no feasible subset can contain more than `k` elements. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nThe number returned by the algorithm equals the size of the greedy subset.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm exactly implements the greedy procedure described in Lemma 2,\ncounting how many items can be taken before the capacity would be exceeded.\n∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \n`maxPalindromesAfterOperations` returns the maximum possible number of\npalindromic words after any sequence of allowed swaps.\n\n**Proof.**  \nLet `G` be the set of words selected by the algorithm.\nBy Lemma 1, because the total required pairs of `G` do not exceed\n`totalPairs`, the words in `G` can indeed be turned into palindromes,\nso the algorithm’s answer is attainable.\n\nAssume there exists a feasible arrangement with more palindromes than\n`|G|`. The corresponding set of words would be a feasible subset larger\nthan `G`, contradicting Lemma 2.  \nTherefore no arrangement can have more palindromes than the algorithm\nproduces. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 5.

The block’s first element\ndiffers by `1` from `Ai`, and its last element differs by `1` from `Ai+1`\nby construction. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nDuring the whole execution the algorithm always processes the *first*\npair (smallest index) whose neighbours differ by more than `1`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe outer `while` loop restarts the scan from the beginning after each\ninsertion. Inside the `for` loop indices increase from `0` upwards, and the\nfirst index that satisfies the condition triggers the insertion and the\n`break`. Therefore the processed pair is exactly the first bad pair. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nThe algorithm terminates.\n\n**Proof.**  \nEach insertion strictly reduces the number of *bad* adjacent pairs:\nby Lemma&nbsp;2 the processed pair becomes good and never becomes bad again.\nThe total number of adjacent pairs is finite (`len(A)-1`), so after finitely\nmany iterations no bad pair remains and the loop ends. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe sequence printed by the algorithm is identical to the sequence obtained\nby repeatedly applying the procedure from the problem statement.\n\n**Proof.**  \nWe compare one iteration of the official procedure with one iteration of\nthe algorithm.\n\n*Both* select the first adjacent pair whose difference is not `1`\n(Lemma&nbsp;3).  \nBoth insert exactly the missing integers in the correct order\n(Lemma&nbsp;1).  \nConsequently after the iteration the whole sequence is the same for both\nprocesses, and the set of bad pairs is reduced in the same way\n(Lemma&nbsp;2).\n\nSince the initial sequences are equal, by induction the sequences remain\nequal after every iteration.  \nBoth stop when no bad pair exists; by Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm stops,\nand the official procedure also stops by definition.  \nThus the final sequences coincide. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Complexity Analysis  \n\nLet `M` be the length of the final sequence ( `M < 10 000` ).\n\n*Each iteration* scans the sequence once → `O(M)` time.  \nThe number of iterations ≤ number of original adjacent pairs (`N‑1 ≤ 99`),\nbecause each iteration fixes at least one bad pair forever.\nHence total time `O(N·M)`, well below one millisecond for the given limits.\n\nMemory consumption is `O(M)` for storing the sequence.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Reference Implementation  (Python 3)\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve() -> None:\n    data = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    if not data:\n        return\n    n = int(data[0])\n    A = list(map(int, data[1:1 + n]))\n\n    while True:\n        found = False\n        for i in range(len(A) - 1):\n            if abs(A[i] - A[i + 1]) != 1:\n                found = True\n                if A[i] < A[i + 1]:\n                    insert = list(range(A[i] + 1, A[i + 1]))\n                else:\n                    insert = list(range(A[i] - 1, A[i + 1], -1))\n                # splice the new numbers\n                A = A[:i + 1] + insert + A[i + 1:]\n                break   # restart scanning from the beginning\n        if not found:\n            break\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, A)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```\n\nThe program follows exactly the algorithm proven correct above and conforms\nto the required input‑output format.", "explanation": "Pass@1: 0.0%", "metadata": {"pass_rate": 0.0, "timeout": 6, "debug": false, "eval_results": {"0": [[-4]]}, "final_metadata": [["{\"error_code\": -4, \"error_message\": \"Error during testing: invalid character '\\u2026' (U+2026) (<string>, line 1)\"}"]]}, "main_score_name": "pass"}, "sample_id": 191, "group_id": 191, "sample_metadata": null}}

Let `i` be the last candy visited.\nThe part of the walk before the final segment is a walk that starts at `S`,\nvisits exactly the candies of `mask` and ends at `i`; its length is at least\n`dp[mask][i]` (Lemma&nbsp;3).  \nThe final segment has length at least `d(candy i , G)`.  \nThus the whole walk has length ≥ `dp[mask][i] + d(candy i , G)`.\nTaking the minimum over all possible last candies gives a lower bound\n`best(mask)`.\n\nConversely, for the `i` attaining the minimum we can concatenate\n* an optimal walk achieving `dp[mask][i]` (Lemma&nbsp;3) and\n* a shortest walk from `i` to `G` (Lemma&nbsp;1).  \nThe total length equals `best(mask)`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 5  \nA subset `mask` of candies can be collected within the time limit `T`\n*iff* `best(mask) ≤ T`.\n\n**Proof.** Directly from Lemma&nbsp;4: `best(mask)` is the smallest possible\nlength of a walk that collects exactly those candies and finishes at `G`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 6  \nThe algorithm outputs the maximum cardinality of a subset of candies that\nsatisfies `best(mask) ≤ T`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm enumerates every subset `mask`.  \nFor each it computes `best(mask)` using the DP values (Lemma&nbsp;4) and\nchecks the condition of Lemma&nbsp;5.\nWhenever the condition holds, it updates the answer with `|mask|`.\nTherefore after the loop the stored answer equals the largest `|mask|`\nfulfilling the condition. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe program prints  \n\n* `-1` if and only if reaching the goal within `T` moves is impossible,  \n* otherwise the maximum possible number of distinct candy squares that can be\n  visited on a walk from `S` to `G` of length at most `T`.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If `d(S,G) > T`* – by Lemma&nbsp;1 no walk can be that short, the program\noutputs `-1`.  \n\n*Otherwise* `d(S,G) ≤ T`.  \nEvery feasible walk corresponds to a subset `mask` of visited candies.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;5 the subset satisfies `best(mask) ≤ T`.  \nConversely, for any subset with `best(mask) ≤ T` Lemma&nbsp;5 guarantees a\nfeasible walk.  \nHence the set of feasible subsets is exactly the set examined in Lemma&nbsp;6,\nand the program returns the largest cardinality among them. ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 6.

Correctness Proof  \n\nWe prove that the algorithm prints *Yes* iff a required ordering exists.\n\n---\n\n##### Lemma 1  \nFor any subset `mask` and vertex `v` (`v` in `mask`),  \n`dp[mask][v] = True` **iff** there exists a sequence of distinct vertices\n`p1 , p2 , … , pk` (`k = |mask|`) such that  \n\n* `pk = v`\n* the set `{p1,…,pk}` equals the vertices represented by `mask`\n* for every `i < k` the edge `(pi , pi+1)` exists (i.e. `dist = 1`).\n\n**Proof.** By induction over the size of `mask`.\n\n*Base* `|mask| = 1`. The only possible `v` is the single vertex in the mask.\n`dp[mask][v]` is set to `True` by initialization, and the sequence consisting\nof that single vertex satisfies the statement.\n\n*Induction step.* Assume the statement holds for all masks of size `s`\n(`s < N`).  \nTake a mask of size `s+1` and a vertex `v` inside it.\n`dp[mask][v]` can become `True` only by the transition from a smaller mask\n`mask' = mask \\ {v}` and some `u` with `dp[mask'][u] = True` and an edge\n`(u , v)`. By induction hypothesis there is a suitable sequence ending in `u`\ncovering exactly `mask'`. Appending `v` yields a sequence for `mask, v`.\nConversely, any such sequence ending in `v` must have its predecessor `u`\nand the prefix covering `mask'`. By induction hypothesis `dp[mask'][u] = True`,\nhence the transition sets `dp[mask][v] = True`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf the algorithm outputs **Yes**, then the given strings can be reordered\nto satisfy condition (1).\n\n**Proof.** Output **Yes** means there exists a `last` with\n`dp[FullMask][last] = True`. By Lemma&nbsp;1 there is a sequence of all `N`\nvertices where consecutive vertices are connected by an edge, i.e. their\nstrings differ in exactly one character. This sequence is a valid ordering\n`T1 … TN`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf there exists a reordering `T1 … TN` satisfying (1), the algorithm outputs\n**Yes**.\n\n**Proof.** The ordering defines a Hamiltonian path in the graph.\nConsider the mask after processing the first `k` strings of the ordering,\nending at vertex `Tk`. By Lemma&nbsp;1 (proved forward direction) the DP entry\n`dp[mask][Tk]` becomes `True`. Proceeding inductively over `k = 1 … N`,\nthe final mask `FullMask` and last vertex `TN` obtain `dp[FullMask][TN] = True`,\nso the algorithm will find a `True` entry and output **Yes**. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm prints **Yes** exactly when a permutation of the given strings\nexists such that each consecutive pair differs in exactly one character.\n\n**Proof.** Directly from Lemma&nbsp;2 (soundness) and Lemma&nbsp;3 (completeness). ∎\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.

Hence `a + b ≤ a + b*`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 2  \nIf the algorithm, for a given `a`, updates the answer with `a + b`,\nthen `(a , b)` is a feasible pair and its sum is the maximum among all\nfeasible pairs that use this particular `a`.\n\n**Proof.**  \nThe algorithm chooses `b` exactly as `b*` from Lemma&nbsp;1\n(the rightmost element `≤ a + D`).  \nIt updates the answer only if `b ≥ a - D`, i.e. when the pair is feasible.\nBy Lemma&nbsp;1 this `b` gives the largest possible sum for this `a`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 3  \nIf a feasible pair exists, the algorithm will consider at least one of\nits two elements as the outer loop variable and will update the answer\nwith a sum that is **not smaller** than the sum of that pair.\n\n**Proof.**  \nTake any feasible pair `(a₀ , b₀)`.  \nWhen the outer loop processes `a = a₀`, the binary search finds the\nlargest `b ≤ a₀ + D`. Because `b₀` itself satisfies `b₀ ≤ a₀ + D`,\nthe found `b` is **≥** `b₀`.  \nSince the pair is feasible, `b₀ ≥ a₀ - D`; the algorithm’s test\n`b ≥ a₀ - D` also holds for the found `b`.  \nThus the algorithm updates the answer with `a₀ + b ≥ a₀ + b₀`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Lemma 4  \nIf the algorithm finishes with answer `-1`, no feasible pair exists.\n\n**Proof.**  \nAssume a feasible pair existed. By Lemma&nbsp;3 the algorithm would have\nupdated the answer to at least the sum of that pair, contradicting the\nfinal value `-1`. ∎\n\n\n\n##### Theorem  \nThe algorithm outputs  \n\n* `-1` iff no pair `(a , b)` satisfies `|a-b| ≤ D`;\n* otherwise the maximum possible value of `a + b` among all feasible\n  pairs.\n\n**Proof.**  \n\n*If the algorithm outputs `-1`*: by Lemma&nbsp;4 no feasible pair exists.\n\n*If the algorithm outputs a non‑negative value `S`*:  \nlet `(â , b̂)` be the pair that caused the last update, so `S = â + b̂`.  \nBy Lemma&nbsp;2 this pair is feasible and gives the largest sum among\nall pairs that use `â`.  \nFor any other feasible pair `(a , b)` Lemma&nbsp;3 guarantees that when\nthe loop processes `a` the algorithm updates the answer to at least\n`a + b`.
